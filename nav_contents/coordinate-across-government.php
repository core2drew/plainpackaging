                <p>Because of issues such as business regulation, excise tax, and cooperation in combating the
                    illicit trade in tobacco, the tobacco industry will often have closer links with Ministries
                    other than Health Ministries — such as trade, business, treasury, customs and revenue,
                    intellectual property, and the foreign affairs office. These other ministries will have their
                    own concerns and agendas and may seek to delay or prevent adoption and implementation of
                    plain packaging because of those concerns.</p>
                <p>To assist with the initial coordination with other government ministries, this Toolkit
                    includes a series of POLICY BRIEFS which provide basic information about the
                    policy and address the key opposing arguments, explaining the evidence and why those
                    arguments are flawed.</p>
                <p>Plain packaging does have implications for these other ministries, which they will need to
                    provide input on. For instance, plain packaging will impact on treasury receipts and there
                    are alleged impacts on down trading and illicit trade (<i>see</i> <b>GUIDE 1.3</b>).
                    Notwithstanding these concerns, the critical public health agenda should remain the
                    priority.</p>

                <div class="section-secondary-title fc-orange">1. Whole of government approach</div>
                <p>It is important that coordination occurs across departments to ensure that there is an agreed
                    approach, that the other ministries understand the need for the policy and are not
                    influenced by the tobacco industry’s contrived arguments opposing it. It is useful to have agreed
                    lines on each of the key issues that will be alleged by the industry so that mixed messages
                    are not put out by different parts of government.</p>
                <p>One possible approach is to form a cross government working group. Another is to ensure all
                    correspondence to any government department about plain packaging are directed to the
                    Ministry of Health for a response. Establishing a whole of government approach to the
                    policy, where possible, can be important for its success and early engagement with the other
                    ministries can be key. For instance, in the UK Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
                    produced a full analysis of the likely impact of plain packaging on the illicit market. This
                    analysis identified no evidence or reasons that plain packaging would increase the overall
                    burden of illicit tobacco, <sup>1</sup> which was highly useful in combatting industry arguments.</p>

                    governments
                </div>
                <p>It can sometimes help to have external experts on these issues address officials from the
                    other ministries. For instance, one of the arguments that is put forward most strongly by
                    the tobacco industry is that plain packaging will increase illicit trade. This argument can
                    be very effective in causing concern within other government departments or with members of
                    parliament. However, it is a contrived argument used by the industry to oppose many tobacco
                    control measures, and the evidence to support the argument in relation to plain packaging is
                    extremely weak. There are a number of academic researchers who are able to demonstrate effectively and
                    convincingly how the industry is wrong in its allegations about illicit trade.
                    If a Ministry of Health considers that an external expert could assist in the policy
                    development or governmental/parliamentary processes, CTFK may be able to help with identifying
                    appropriate persons and organizing their visit.</p>
                <p>In addition, government officials from countries that have already implemented plain
                    packaging are often willing to provide information about their policy development, and
                    there are many instances of official government visits taking place in relation to the
                    proposed policy. It is highly recommended that Ministry of Health officials make contact
                    with counterparts in those countries that have already adopted plain packaging laws.</p>
