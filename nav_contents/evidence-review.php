                    and by whom, can also be crucial in demonstrating proper due process.

                    Over the course of 20-30 years, there have been many peer-reviewed scientific research
                    studies looking at the likely impact plain packaging of tobacco would have on smoking
                    behaviors and attitudes and how that would impact on smoking rates. Research has been
                    conducted in ten different countries using a range of methodologies, and each study taken
                    in isolation only provides part of the picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Countries that have already adopted plain packaging have commissioned independent
                    reviews of the research to ensure that there is a clear, complete, and balanced picture
                    of what the overall evidence is on the impact plain packaging will have. By the time of
                    the Hammond Review in 2014, a total of 69 original empirical research studies were
                    reviewed (as of October 2016 that number had increased to over 75 relevant studies). The
                    four reviews show that the evidence on plain packaging is notable for its breadth and
                    diversity of methods but also for its consistency in the results. The evidence reviews
                    were:

                <p>All these reviews reach the same conclusion: that there is strong and highly consistent
                    evidence to support the argument that plain packaging would contribute to its objectives (as set out

                        <p><b>Marketing theory</b> demonstrates that packaging has a number of functions,
                            including assisting consumers to identify and distinguish brands, but that it is
                            also used to promote the product as an important component of overall marketing
                            strategy. Packaging can heighten a product’s appeal and create positive
                            impressions and emotional connections to help "drive the sale."</p>
                        <p><b>Packaging of tobacco products</b> has been shown to be more important as a
                            promotional tool than for other products. Firstly, in many countries where there
                            are TAPS bans, it is the last remaining means of advertising a brand. Secondly,
                            tobacco product packs are a "badge product," because users regularly openly
                            display their packs in public <sup>11</sup>.</p>

                            cigarettes, which have a high degree of social visibility. Unlike many other
                            consumer products, cigarette packages are displayed each time the product is
                            used and are often left in public view between uses. As a result, both smokers
                            and non-smokers report high levels of exposure to tobacco packaging…”</p>

                    arguments opposing plain packaging
                    are almost wholly unfounded, and there are a number of research studies that have
                    demonstrated this <sup>14</sup>; but a fair process requires proper consideration of all views.</p>

                <div class="section-secondary-title fc-green">7. Local evidence and research</div>
                <p>In addition to the solid global evidence base supporting the adoption of plain packaging,
                    it is a policy recommended by the implementation guidelines to the evidence based WHO FCTC.
                    This provides effective grounding for a government decision to proceed with the
                    policy without the necessity of commissioning new local research or studies into its
                    likely impact in a particular country. From a legal perspective, this position has been
                    confirmed in the ruling by the international investment tribunal in PMI v. Uruguay.
                    <sup>15</sup></p>

                <p>However, governments should not be dissuaded from commissioning or conducting studies or
                    research into the policy in their country. Additional evidence will be useful for any
                    government seeking to defend the policy against tobacco-industry attacks. In addition,
                    there may be circumstances particular to a country that would warrant new research. For
                    instance, in Uruguay, there is a brand of cigarettes that has packaging using a color
                    very similar to the green/brown color used for tobacco-product plain packaging in
                    Australia, the UK, France, Ireland, and Hungary. Positive associations may have already
                    developed in relation to that color by on the part of some consumers. Some country-specific research
                    into the most appropriate color to use could be of use in such circumstances.</p>
