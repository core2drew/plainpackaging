            <p>The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is an
                evidence based, legally binding multilateral treaty with 180 parties, and one of the most
                widely ratified treaties in the UN system. Its purpose is to ‘protect present and future
                generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of
                tobacco use and exposure from tobacco smoke’ (WHO FCTC Article 3).</p>

                Products
            </div>
            <p>Article 11 <u>obliges</u> Parties to implement <u>effective measures</u> to ensure that
                tobaccopackaging and labelling do not promote tobacco products by means that are
                false,misleading or deceptive (Article 11.1(a)) and to ensure that tobacco packaging carries
                health warnings describing the harmful effects of tobacco use (Article 11.1(b)).</p>
            <p>The <a href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>evidence/research-evidence">evidence</a> clearly
                demonstrates that plain packaging:</p>
            <ul class="custom">
                <li>Is an <u>effective measure</u> to address misleading and deceptive packaging.</li>
                <li>Increases the noticeability and <u>effectiveness</u> of health warnings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Paragraph 46 of the Guidelines for the implementation of Article 11 states:</p>
            <div class="p-states">
                <p>
                    Parties should consider adopting measures to restrict or prohibit the use of logos,
                    colors, brand images or promotional information on packaging other than brand names and
                    product names displayed in a standard colour and font style (<u>plain packaging</u>).
                    This may increase the noticeability and effectiveness of health warnings and messages,
                    prevent the package from detracting attention from them, and address industry package
                    design techniques that may suggest that some products are less harmful than others.

            <p>This passage is set out in a broader context of other packaging and labelling measures, which
                reinforces the recommendation that plain packaging is adopted in addition to (not as an
                alternative to) other measures including large pictorial health warnings.</p>

            <p>Article 13 <u>obliges</u> Parties to undertake a <u>comprehensive ban</u> on tobacco
                advertising, promotion and sponsorship. The phrase “tobacco advertising and promotion” is
                defined in Article 1(c) as “any form of commercial communication, recommendation or action
                with the aim, effect or likely effect of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use either
                directly or indirectly.”</p>
            <p><a href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>evidence/tobacco-product-branding">Evidence</a> demonstrates
                that branding on tobacco packaging acts as a form of advertising and promotion. The research
                evidence is also clear that plain packaging will act to:</p>
            <ul class="custom">
                <li>Eliminate the effects of tobacco packaging as a form of advertising and promotion</li>
                <li>Reduce the attractiveness of tobacco products.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Guidelines for Implementation of Article 13recommend that Parties consider implementing
                plain packaging. Paragraph 15, 16 and 17 state</p>
            <div class="p-states">
                <p>15. <u>Packaging is an important element of advertising and promotion.</u> Tobacco pack
                    or product features are used in various ways to attract consumers, to promote products
                    and to cultivate and promote brand identity, for example by using logos, colours,fonts,
                    pictures, shapes and materials on or in packs or on individual cigarettes or other
                    tobacco products.</p>
                <p>16. <u>The effect of advertising or promotion on packaging can be eliminated by requiring
                        plain packaging:</u> black and white or two other contrasting colours, as prescribed
                    by national authorities; nothing other than a brand name, a product name and/or
                    manufacturer’s name, contact details and the quantity of product in the
                    packaging,without any logos or other features apart from health warnings, tax stamps and
                    other government-mandated information or markings; prescribed font style and size; and
                    standardized shape, size and materials. There should be no advertising or promotion
                    inside or attached to the package or on individual cigarettes or other tobacco products.
                </p>
                <p>17. <u>Packaging and product design are important elements of advertising and promotion.
                        Parties should consider adopting plain packaging requirements to eliminate the
                        effects of advertising or promotion on packaging</u>. Packaging, individual
                    cigarettes or other tobacco products should carry no advertising or promotion, including
                    design features that make products attractive.</p>

            <p>The tobacco companies argue that as a framework convention, the WHO FCTC limits itself to the
