            <p><b>Five independent systematic evidence reviews</b> <sup>1</sup> have been published which
                consider
                over 70 peer
                reviewed scientific research studies, notable for their breadth and diversity of methods,and
                for strong consistency in showing that plain packaging will contribute to reducing smoking
                rates. There is also 4 years’ post implementation research and statistical data from
                Australia all of which points towards the measure being effective. </p>
            <p>The Chantler Review from the UK stated thatall the evidence “points in a single direction,
                and I am not aware of any convincing evidence pointing the other way.” <sup>2</sup></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>None of the studies used by the tobacco industry to oppose plain packaging have been peer
                reviewed; almost all were funded by the industry and have been the subject of serious
                criticism by academics and judges for their flawed methodology. <sup>3</sup></p>
            <p>The official statistical evidence from Australia shows an increase in the rate of decline of
                both smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption after implementation. The PIR analysis
                attributes a 0.55 percentage point reduction in smoking rates to plain packaging, equivalent
                to 118,000 less smokers over the 34 months after implementation. <sup>4</sup></p>

            <p><b>Even Philip Morris has said that branded packs using the most complex holographic designs
                    are
                    already cheap and easy to counterfeit</b> <sup>5</sup>. Plain packaging retains
                colourful health
                warnings,
                tax stamps and covert tracking codes and so will not be significantly cheaper to counterfeit

            <p>Illicit trade is affected by supply and demand. Plain packaging does not increase demand for
                illicit tobacco but reduces overall demand for tobacco. Supply is impacted by effective
                enforcement action which is also not effected by plain packaging. </p>
            <p><b>The tobacco industry has for years been complicit in the illicit market</b> by
                oversupplying low
                tax regimes <sup>6</sup>. The industry simply cannot be trusted in relation to the
                illicit market
                .</p>
            <p><b>In Australia, the proportion of illicit tobacco on the market has stayed the same</b> or
                reduced
                since implementation <sup>7</sup>. </p>
            <p>The Customs and Revenue department in the UK produced a detailed report that concluded plain
                packaging will have no impact on the size of the illicit market. <sup>8</sup></p>
            <p><b>The tobacco industry has exaggerated the data and manipulated the press</b> over this
                issue
                <sup>9</sup>
                .</p>
            
            <p><b>The only study relied on by the industry on illicit trade in Australia is by KPMG</b> in
                which
                the methodology used is fundamentally flawed <sup>10</sup>. Even the KPMG report finds that
                <i>“Through to
                    the end of 2014, there has been no evidence of counterfeit plain packaging

                also wrote to the UK government stating the report <i>does not</i> support <i>“the
                    contention that
                    plain paper packaging could lead of itself to an increase in tobacco smuggling”</i>.
            </p>
            <p><b>In their legal challenges to plain packaging the tobacco companies submitted no
                    supporting evidence, data or experts</b> and made this claim “by mere assertion”

            <p><b>After plain packaging in Australia, tobacco companies continued to increase their prices
                    in
                    all market sectors</b>, over and above the tax rate increases <sup>12</sup>. Even if

            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-dark-brown">Industry Argument It is the start of a
                slippery slope and will lead to plain packaging for other products.
            </div>

            <p><b>Tobacco is a uniquely damaging product which requires unique regulations</b>. Only tobacco
                control is the subject of the first and only public health international treaty. The aim of
                tobacco control it to eradicate all tobacco use and have a ‘tobacco free society’. This is
                not the case for the regulatory control of other potentially unhealthy consumer
                products.</p>

            <p><b>The tobacco industry often uses the ‘slippery slope’ argument to try to resist tobacco
                    control measures <sup>13</sup> such as health warnings</b>. To date, only tobacco
                products carry
                large graphic
                health warnings so the slippery slope argument has not turned out to be true for other
                tobacco control measures. </p>

            <p><b>Tobacco is the only product that the World Health Organization recommends plain packaging
                    for <sup>14</sup></b>. Plain packaging of other products has not so far been proposed in
                any
                country that
                has
                adopted plain packaging of tobacco products. There is as yet very little research evidence
                in relation to plain packaging of other products that could support such proposals. </p>

            <p><b>Legal rulings in Australia, the UK, France and the EU as well as an international
                    investment
                    tribunal ruling, have all confirmed tobacco packaging regulations not breach domestic or
                    international intellectual property (IP) obligations. <sup>15</sup></b></p>
            <p>Disclosed internal tobacco industry documents show that the tobacco companies received legal
                advice from their own lawyers and from the World Intellectual Property Organisation, that
                plain packaging would not breach international IP obligations because it only controls the
                use of trademarks and does not prevent registration of trademarks. <sup>16</sup></p>
            
            <p><b>IP law gives the trademark owner the right to stop others from using the mark but does
                    not
                    give the owner the unfettered right to use the mark.</b> This has been confirmed by
                national
                courts, investment tribunals and previous WTO panel rulings. <sup>17</sup></p>

            <p>The WTO dispute panel determining the complaint against Australia will soon produce its
                report and is expected to rule that there is no breach of the TRIPS agreement on
                intellectual property. The ruling should be available in July 2017. Governments in
                Australia, UK, France, Ireland, Hungary, and New Zealand have carefully considered their WTO
                and international obligations and decided to proceed with plain packaging legislation.</p>

            </div>
            <p><b>This argument puts tobacco profits before the economic benefits to society. The Economic
                    benefits in reducing smoking rates are huge and far outweigh the costs to the
                    industry.</b></p>
            <p>The Economic Impact Assessment for the UK showed that a 1 percentage point reduction in
                smoking rates resulting from plain packaging would lead to <b>£25billion net benefit to the
                    economy over 10 years</b> due to reduced health care costs and increased productivity
                . <sup>20</sup></p>

            <p><b>Reductions in smoking lead to significant health care savings in the short term</b>. A new
                study
                from the US showed that a 10% relative drop in smoking (meaning, for instance, a drop from
                20% to 18%) would be followed by an expected $63 billion reductionin healthcare expenditure
                the next year. <sup>21</sup></p>

            <p>The tobacco industry consistently exaggerate the impact of tobacco control measures on their
                ability to make profits. In rich economies where smoking rates are falling, tobacco company
                profits still continue to rise. The companies increase their prices, over and above any tax
                rises, and so still increase profits <sup>22</sup>. </p>

            <p>Money not spent on tobacco by those that have quit is then spent on other goods, generating
                alternative employment. Studies show that most countries see no net job losses and that a
                few see net gains if consumption falls <sup>23</sup>.</p>

            </div>

            <p><b>The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and its guidelines</b>, recognise that
                tobacco
                packaging and product design are “important elements of advertising and promotion” and
                recommends standardised packaging as a “means of eliminating the effects of advertising or
                promotion on packaging”. </p>

            <p><b>Packaging is recognised as an important component in of the overall marketing strategy
                    for
                    all consumer goods</b>. Tobacco is no exception. Packaging is particularly important for
                consumer products with a high degree of social visibility, such as cigarettes. Unlike many
                other consumer products, cigarettes are in packages that are displayed each time the product
                is used and are often left in public view between uses.</p>

            <p>The US Surgeon General summarised evidence in 2012 and 2014 and concluded that: ‘The evidence
