            <p>This brief guide gives some of the key principles in approaching the drafting process for
                plain packaging but full details are in <a

            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-blue-green-2">1. Regulate every part of the pack</div>
            <p>Every aspect of the packaging presents the tobacco industry with a potential opportunity to
                introduce novel or different elements that could differentiate and promote the product and
                undermine the intention to create truly standard packs. Experience shows that tobacco
                companies will seek to exploit whatever avenue is left to them to differentiate their
                product in a way that is attractive or that allows positive associations with the brand.
                The guiding principle behind plain packaging is that the only means of differentiation is
                through the brand and variant name, which are presented in a standard typeface. Achieving
                this requires regulating each aspect of the packaging and the appearance of individual
                products, such as cigarette sticks, including:</p>

            <p>This means the legislation can end up being quite detailed – aiming for simplicity risks the
                tobacco industry developing novel ways to differentiate their products.</p>

            <p>The legislation in force in Australia, the UK, Ireland, France, and Hungary (and, at the time
                of writing the proposed laws in New Zealand, Slovenia, and Norway) are, in their effect, all
                very similar (although there are some differences, which are highlighted in this
                toolkit).</p>
            <p>There have been a number of positive legal rulings on challenges to plain packaging laws in
                Australia, the EU, and the UK, and a ruling is expected in early July 2017 on a WTO dispute (<i>see</i>
                <a href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>procedural-steps-for-a-secure-policy/wto-notification"><b
                            class="fc-blue-green-2">Guide 4.3</b></a>). Some of the evidence supporting the
                policy is based around the specific policy decisions that were first developed in Australia.
                Deviating from those key evidence based policy decisions could risk providing tobacco
                companies with sufficient grounds to mount legal challenges.</p>
            <p>Countries considering plain packaging should therefore be cautious of introducing legislation
                that differs significantly from the plain packaging laws already in force. Emulating
                existing laws will allow the government to rely on both the evidence base and the positive
                legal rulings from around the world.</p>

            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-blue-green-2">3. Keep it flexible</div>
            <p>It is prudent to adopt legislation that allows for subsequent changes through delegated
                regulatory powers to the appropriate ministry. Unanticipated issues may arise and the
                tobacco industry will inevitably try to find ways to undermine the policy.</p>

                    <p>The color of packs provides a good example of the need for detail and for emulating
                        existing legislation. Unless the exact color required for the packaging is
                        prescribed very precisely, variations of color will appear, defeating the intention
                        of standardizing packaging. Simply requiring ‘brown’, or a ‘green/brown’ in
                        legislation is insufficient. Australia commissioned research into which color was
                        perceived to be the least appealing for tobacco packaging :</p>

            <p>Pantone 448C (opaque couche) with a matt finish is the dull brown/green color specified in
                the Australian, the UK, Ireland, France, and Hungary legislation for the packaging.<sup>1</sup>

            <p><b>Pantone Cool Grey 2 C</b> with a matt finish is the color specified in those countries for
                any text permitted on the packaging, such as brand name or contact details.</p>

            <p>Unless there is specific evidence or research that demonstrates different colors would be
                more effective in a particular country at achieving the aims of the policy, it is
                recommended that these colors are used in all plain packaging legislation because of the
                research already conducted that demonstrates the color seffectiveness. A ‘matt finish’ to
                the surface should also be specified to avoid some packs appearing with a glossy finish.</p>

                    <p>This is another area where it is recommended that particular care be taken to provide
                        detail and to follow existing legislation. Many of the policy decisions in
                        Australia, the UK, and Ireland require cigarette packs to be in the form that is
                        generally the standard or most common type of packet - a cuboid box made of
                        cardboard with 20 cigarettes in it, which uses a flip top lid. Because this is the
                        most common form of packaging for cigarettes, tobacco companies will not have to
                        make any major adjustments to their machinery to produce this packaging and
                        therefore it is a least restrictive approach that should be followed unless a
                        different type or style of packet is more common in the particular country
                        considering plain packaging.</p>

                provision
            </div>
            <p>There are important legal reasons to ensure that tobacco companies can maintain their
                    trademark registrations, even if the use of those trademarks is severely restricted by
                    plain packaging. There are international, regional, and national laws that oblige
                states to maintain trademark registrations. For instance Article 15 of the WTO Trade Related
                aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) obliges member states to permit
                registration of signs as trademarks so long as they are capable of distinguishing the goods
                of one undertaking from those of another.</p>
            <p>In most jurisdictions non-use of a trademark in practice can lead to applications for
                de-registration of that trademark, typically after five years, where there is no good reason for
                the non-use.</p>
            <p>If a country’s plain packaging laws mean that tobacco trademarks are fully prohibited or the
                trademark registration will necessarily be liable to cancelation, this may breach
                international obligations. In addition, plain packaging is better viewed as a control on the
                use of trademarks rather than a deprivation or expropriation of trademarks.</p>
            <p>Therefore, most plain packaging legislation (for instance in Australia, the UK, and Ireland1) has
                a trademark registration saving provision that which states that the legislation does not amount
                to a prohibition on the use of the trademarks in all circumstances, and that non-use of a
                trademark as a result of the legislation amounts to a good reason for non-use.</p>
            <p>The way in which plain packaging might otherwise intersect with a country’s domestic
                trademark laws needs to be considered carefully.</p>
            <p>An example of a trademark registration saving provision is in the <b>TEMPLATE MODEL LAWin the
                    Tools and Resources </b> at
                Article 13.</p>
