                Deputies but has since remained inactive, although pressure continues for it to be
                debated.</p>

            <p>ECUADOR— A bill for plain packaging was introduced to the National Assembly on August 3,
                2016, <sup>25</sup> which has subsequently been assigned to the health committee.</p>

            <p>CANADA— The Liberal government had plain packaging as one of its manifesto commitments, and,
                in November 2015, it was set as a priority for the Health Department in a formal letter of
                mandate from the Prime Minister to the Health Minister. In May 2016, the government
                commenced a consultation <sup>27</sup> on detailed proposals for plain packaging, which
                ran until the
                end
                of August 2016.</p>

            <p>FINLAND — The Government National Action Plan <sup>28</sup> included plain packaging as a
                planned
                measure
                in June 2014. Legislation was introduced in July 2016 to implement the EU TPD, which did not
                include plain packaging.</p>

            <p>SINGAPORE— The Health Promotion Board commenced a public consultation on plain packaging from

            <p>SWEDEN— The Minister of Health directed the committee examining the implementation of the EU
                TPD to also consider plain packaging. The committee report, <sup>31</sup> presented in
                March 2016,
                concluded that plain packaging would require a change to the Swedish constitution. The bill
                to implement the EU TPD was expected in 2016. It is not clear whether the bill will include
                plain packaging.</p>
            <p>TAIWAN— On February 13, 2017, a draft Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act Amendment Bill was

            <p><sup>34</sup> EU Tobacco Products Directive introduces some pack standardization provisions
                (on shape and minimum quantities together with 65 percent front and back picture health
                warnings) but does not itself impose full standardized packaging. Instead it provides the EU
                Member States with the ability to act directly through domestic legislation (“Accordingly,
                Member States could, for example, introduce provisions providing for further standardization
                of the packaging of tobacco products, provided that those provisions are compatible with the
                TFEU [Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union], with WTO obligations and do not
                affect the full application of this Directive.” Article 24.2 Directive 2014/40/EU of the
                European Parliamentand of the Council of April 3, 2014.</p>
