                    1.1 The “right to use” a trademark
                </div>

                <p>The tobacco industry claims that plain packaging interferes with itstrademark rights in a
                    way that conflicts with domestic, regional, and international intellectual property laws
                    and obligations. Most of itsarguments rely— in some way— on the contention that
                    registered trademarksafford the owner a <i>positive right to use</i> that trademark.
                    They argue that this principle is found in international law, under the World Trade
                    Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
                    (TRIPS)as well as being recognized under national trademark laws as either an implicit
                    or explicit right.</p>

                <p><span class="fc-ref-mat-4"><b>Internal documents from the tobacco companies</b></span>
                    also show that they received advice from their own lawyers, and from the director of the
                    World Intellectual Property Organization, dating as far back as 1994, that plain
                    packaging would not breach international intellectual property law.<sup>4</sup></p>

                <p>In recent decisions, courts and tribunals havealso rejected this argument. Instead, these
                    bodies have adopted a traditional view thattrademark rights allow the owner to prevent
                    other people from using the trademark. This “right to exclude”does not include an
                    absoluteright to use the trademark in any and all situations but is limited,
                    particularly where a government is regulating and limiting the use inthe public

                    The “exclusive right to use” in national trademark acts.
                </h3>
                <p>In most countries, national trademark legislation clearly sets out the nature of the
                    right conferred on a trademark owner as being a right to exclude or prevent others from
                    using the trademark for the product or service for which it is registered.<sup>10</sup>
                    However, in some countries, the trademark legislation is drafted to afford the owner an
                    “exclusive right to use” the trademark.</p>

                <p>One example is the Australian Trade Marks Act 1995 <sup>11</sup>:</p>

                <ul class="no-list-style">

                            (1) If a trademark is registered, the registered owner of the trademark has,
                            subject to this Part, the exclusive rights:<br><span
                                class="padding-left-25">(a)</span> to use the trademark; and<br>
                            <span class="padding-left-25">(b)</span> to authorise other persons to use the
                            trademark;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trademark is
                            registered.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The tobacco companies’ constitutional legal claim against plain packaging in Australia
                    led to a decision on the nature of the trademark right under the Australian
                    Constitution. The Australian High Court ruled that the right conferred by trademarks was
                    exclusive in nature and could only be asserted to stop others from using the mark. The
                    right could not be used to prevent government regulations that restricted the companies’
                    use of their trademarks. The Court said:</p>

                <ul class="no-list-style">
                    <li>
                        <p>“Strictly speaking, the right subsisting in the owner of a trademark is a
                            negative and not a positive right. It is to be understood as a right to exclude
                            others from using the mark and cannot be viewed as separate from the trade in
                            connection with which it is used.” [para 348]</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>While the decisions on the nature of trademarks have held in favor of an “exclusive
                    right,” intellectual property law issues are complex. Plain packaging policies do place
                    strict restrictions and controls on the use of trademarks on product packaging. Given
                    these restrictions it is important that separate legal consideration is given to the way
                    in which plain packaging laws would interact with domestic or national intellectual
                    property laws.</p>

                <p>As indicated above in section 2.1, the main concern as to compatibility with national
                    intellectual property laws is the argument that registration provides an explicit or

                    plain packaging laws. The tobacco companies raise some other issues.</p>
                <p>While there may be some complexity to these legal arguments, they are basically a
                    different way of arguing for a “right to use” the tobacco trademarks. As shown in 2.1
                    above, these arguments have been rejected by the Courts.</p>

                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>to distinguish the product in question as originating from a particular undertaking
                        or producer
                    </li>
                    <li>to prevent confusion for the consumer</li>
                    <li>to guarantee the identity of the origin of the product to the consumer</li>
                    <li>to guarantee quality</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The companies argue that where tobacco advertising bans exist, packaging is the only
                    remaining place that word and figurative trademarks for tobacco products is still
                    permitted and so can perform these essential functions. The tobacco companies argue that
                    courts have upheld the fundamental importance of these essential functions of
                    trademarks.</p>

                <p>
                    <span class="fc-ref-mat-4"><b>Trademarks with a high reputation</b></span> Some national
                    trademark acts provide increased protections for trademarks that have acquired a higher
                    reputation. The tobacco companies argue that because plain packaging means they cannot
                    use their trademarks, the reputation of those marks will be reduced, and thus they will
                    lose protections that were previously guaranteed under national law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="fc-ref-mat-4"><b>Revocation of a trademark for non-use:</b></span> Many
                    national trademark acts have a provision that allows an application for revocation of a
                    trademark’s registration where it has not been used for five years or more and there is
                    no good reason for its non-use. The tobacco companies argue that plain packaging will
                    inevitably mean they do not use their trademarks, which could lead to applications for
                    revocation. This could lead to them being deprived of their marks. This argument can be
                    addressed effectively with a trademark-saving provision as outlined in <a

                    rights in trademarks</h3>
                <p>The tobacco companies claim that restricting or controlling the use of trademarks on the
                    packaging of tobacco products through plain packaging laws, has the effect of “taking”
                    or “appropriating” their property rights in those trademarks.</p>
                <p>It is generally accepted that trademarks are a form of property, and so there is the
                    potential for the trademarks rights to be taken or acquired by others. The issue is then
                    whether plain packaging laws result in a regulatory or indirect “taking” for which
                    tobacco companies should receive compensation.</p>
                <p>Property rights, or the freedom to peaceful enjoyment of property, are protected in many
                    countries’ constitutions, as well as in regional Human Rights treaties. In addition,
                    foreign investors are given protections under international investment treaties to
                    prevent the unlawful “expropriation” of their investments by states. Different
                    jurisdictions use different terminology for this taking, such as
                    “expropriation,”“acquisition,” or “deprivation” and varying legal tests are applied.
                    These claims that plain packaging amounts to expropriation of these rights have been
                    rejected by courts across all jurisdictions:</p>

                    1.4 Freedom of expression and freedom to conduct a business or trade
                </h3>
                <p>Many national constitutions, as well as regional human rights treaties, provide for the
                    right to freedom of expression and the right to conduct a business or trade. The tobacco
                    industry has claimed that plain packaging laws violate these rights. </p>
                <p>In any system of rights, there is a balance to be struck between competing rights and
                    freedoms. The freedoms relied upon by the tobacco industry are never expressed in
                    absolute terms and are always subject to laws enacted for the public interest. In many
                    legal systems, the freedom of <i>commercial</i> expression is given a lower priority
                    than other forms of expression, such as political or journalistic freedom of expression.
                    In the case of plain packaging laws, freedom of expression must be balanced against the
                    right to life or health, or simply the inherent right of the state to regulate for the
                    public good.</p>

                <p>However, in some jurisdictions these freedoms are given greater priority. For instance,
                    in the USA, the priority given to the right to commercial freedom of expression would
                    make it more difficult for plain packaging to get past constitutional objections. In
                    Sweden, a public inquiry into a review of the Tobacco Control Act stated that plain
                    packaging of tobacco would be compliant with the European Convention Human Rights and
                    all European Union law but would not be compatible with the current provisions of the
                    Freedom of the Press Act; and should only be introduced if an exception making such a
                    requirement is introduced in the Constitution.<sup>15</sup></p>
                <p>An assessment of these issues needs to be undertaken for each country. However, all the
                    courts that have considered the legislation thus far have found that plain packaging
                    regulation is no different to regulations for warnings or labeling imposed on other
                    products, especially potentially dangerous consumer products. For plain packaging, the
                    balance has always been found to be in favor of the government’s right to regulate to
                    protect public health rather than commercial interests.</p>

                <p>These arguments concern the justification for the measure considering the benefit of the
                    public interest relative to the burden it places on the applicant. Similar principles
                    are applied across many legal jurisdictions, both national and international, and

                    both suitable and necessary to achieve its objectives.</p>
                <p>There is often a balancing of the importance of the objective, the extent to which the
                    measure is capable of achieving the objective, and the degree of interference with an
                    applicant’s interests. <a

                        Set policy objectives</a>, describes the importance of setting clear and measurable
                    objectives for plain packaging. Without clear objectives, courts are faced with a more
                    difficult task in determining this balance. </p>
                <p>Courts are generally willing to accept that tobacco control measures have a legitimate
                    public health objective. The tobacco industry seeks to argue that there is no evidence
                    to support the contention that plain packaging will be effective to reduce smoking rates
                    (and so it is unsuitable to meet its objectives) and that there are alternative more
                    effective measures at reducing smoking rates (and so plain packaging is
                    <i>unnecessary</i>).</p>
                <p>A court or tribunal must therefore undertake an analysis of the evidence in support of
                    the measure to see if it is justified. The intensity of that analysis, the margin of
                    appreciation, or how much deference is given to the government in taking decisions about
                    public health will vary between jurisdictions.</p>

                    This issue concerns the way in which a government conducted the policy development and
                    legislative process. The tobacco industry will often argue that tobacco control measures
                    were adopted:

                <ul class="custom">

                <p>The steps set out in this Toolkit, adapted for compliance with national administrative

                </h3>
                <p>World Trade Organization (WTO) law limits the way in which WTO Members may restrict or
                    regulate international trade in goods and services, and also imposes obligations on the
                    protection of intellectual property rights. The law is enforced through a system of
                    dispute settlement between its Members. This means only the governments of other WTO
                    Member States may bring a complaint that may then be referred to a dispute panel. A
                    panel ruling may be appealed to the Appellate Body.</p>
                <p>The tobacco companies regularly allege in letters and submissions to governments that
                    effective tobacco packaging and labeling laws, including large health warnings and plain
                    packaging, breach the WTO agreements. Ministry of Health officials need to be robust in
                    responding to or dealing with these allegations.</p>
                <p>At the time of writing, a WTO panel is determining complaints against Australia’s plain
                    packaging laws brought by Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Indonesia. The
                    ruling is expected in July 2017. More details about this case are given in the <a
                        href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>resources/case-summaries">Case Summaries</a> page.
                    The main claims made by the complainant countries are that plain packaging:</p>
                <ul class="no-list-style">
                    <li><p>1. breaches the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
                            Rights (TRIPS Agreement) by failing to provide protection of trademark rights as
                            required under that agreement, including by unjustifiably encumbering the use of
                            trademarks in the course of trade.</p></li>
                    <li><p>2. breaches the WTO’s Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade because it
                            constitutes a “technical regulation” that is “more trade-restrictive than
                            necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective.”</p></li>
                    <li><p>3. breaches the WTO’s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994), the
                            Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, and the TRIPS Agreement because the
                            measure discriminates between like imported and domestic products, as well as
                            discriminating between like imported products.</p></li>

                    WTO Members have to regulate in the public interest and that protection of human health

                </h3>
                <p>International Investment Treaties (IITs) are agreements between two or more countries.
                    These agreements give investors located in one party to the IIT protections and legal
                    security for their direct investments into the other party or parties to the IIT. The
                    purpose of IITs is to encourage more direct foreign investment. Almost all nations
                    across the globe have signed up to these agreements and the protections they afford to
                    foreign investors.</p>
                <p>Most IITs include what is known as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions.
                    These provisions provide a system for foreign investors to commence an arbitration claim
                    if the investor believes the government of the host nation has breached their
                    obligations under the IIT. The measures that are challenged can sometimes be genuine,
                    public-interest policies or decisions to protect the environment or public health but
                    which in some way affect the use of the investment or its value.</p>
                <p><span class="fc-ref-mat-4"><b>These claims can be for millions, sometimes billions of dollars in compensation, and the arbitration lawsuits typically take many years to resolve and involve huge legal bills.</b></span>
                    However, one of the primary aims of the tobacco industry in bringing these claims is to
                    create “regulatory chilling effect” and deter other governments from enacting effective
                    tobacco-control regulation. </p>
