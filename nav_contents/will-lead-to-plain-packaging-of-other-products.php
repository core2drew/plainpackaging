                <p>
                    A key argument used in the tobacco industry media campaigns in many countries is that if
                    plain packaging for tobacco is introduced, it sets a precedent for other consumer products,
                    such as soft drinks, alcohol, or fatty foods. The argument is that plain packaging is a step
                    too far towards a “nanny state” and will lead to reduced product innovation across all
                    sectors. In this way, the tobacco industry tries to get support from the other industries in
                    opposing the policy generally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This argument is often put forward in campaigns and media articles by third-party
                    organizations, posing as independent voices but which receive funding from the tobacco
                    industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For instance, in the UK, the “<a href="http://www.handsoffourpacks.com/">Hands Off Our
                        Packs</a>” campaign, run by
                    <a href="http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/Forest">FOREST</a>, strongly pushed
                    this argument forward. The Institute for Economic Affairs, a libertarian think tank, hosted
                    events and published papers opposing plain packaging, using the slippery slope argument. It
                    was an issue regularly cited in media articles about those that oppose plain packaging.
                    <sup>1</sup>
                    Imperial Tobacco UK also deployed the slippery slope argument in an anti-plain packaging
                    <a href="">YouTube video</a> advert in Britain — 2020 Vision. <sup>2</sup> The advert
                    misleadingly
                    suggests that by 2020
                    all products perceived to be unhealthy will be sold in plain packaging. The advert was
                    promoted through the distribution of leaflets on petrol forecourts.

                    In Sweden, the UK, and Canada, the tobacco industry, or groups opposing the plain packaging
                    of tobacco, have even set up whole fake shops as media stunts, where all the products, such
                    as drink, crisps, coffee, etc., are in mock plain packaging with health warnings. The images
                    above are from a convenience store converted by Students for Freedom (a libertarian campaign
                    group that opposes plain packaging) in Canada.

                    In Australia, Imperial Tobacco unrolled a nationwide PR campaign based on the “No Nanny
