            <p><b>Plain Packaging of Tobacco Products</b> is therefore an important element of any
                comprehensive tobacco control strategy, in combination with other policies such as
                prohibitions on tobacco advertising and promotion and large graphic health warnings. There

            <p>This Toolkit is intended to provide governments and civil society organizations with the
                tools needed to ensure robust plain packaging policies and legislation that can stand up to
                Big Tobaccoâ€™s efforts to dilute, delay and defeat the measure.</p>
            <p>The Toolkit sets also out important technical details needed in the development of the policy

                that provide an outline of the steps a government should consider including in its
                development and drafting of legislation. These guides provide a step by step approach
                highlighting key issues and decisions that need to be considered; and signpost the detailed

                    MATERIALS</b>. These set out all the available evidence supporting the policy as well as
                the opposing arguments and their flaws; there is a detailed guide on how to approach
                drafting the law, with examples from existing legislation and a <b>DRAFT MODEL BILL</b> that
                sets out the recommended elements for plain packaging legislation.</p>
            <p>PART 2 also includes templates for a regulatory impact assessment and a template consultation
                document for plain packaging, if government officials decide to undertake these recommended
                procedures. There are also policy briefing papers to assist with media messaging and
