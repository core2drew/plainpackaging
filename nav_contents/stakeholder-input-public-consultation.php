            <p>For novel or complimentary tobacco control polices in particular, allowing all potential
                stakeholders, including industry, the opportunity to make submissions or comments means the
                policy is developed having taken all issues and views into account. The advantages of a
                consultation are that:</p>
            <ul class="custom ">
                <li>government may receive useful comments from public health organizations and experts;</li>
                <li>tobacco companies may submit comments in a transparent fashion rather than behind closed
                    doors;
                </li>
                <li>from a legal perspective, consultation gives governments another rebuttal to the typical
                    tobacco industry arguments about poorly crafted policies and thoughtless regulatory
                    processes;and
                </li>
                <li>media coverage of the consultation can help promote the measures in advance of
                    implementation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most countries (but not all) that have adopted plain packaging laws did so after a process
                that allowed stakeholder input.</p>
            <p>The process for stake holder input should be guided by the normal administrative procedures
                in each country. One option is to have full public consultation; alternatively the process
                may, for instance, form part of parliamentary committee procedures allowing key stakeholders
                to make written submissions or by way of public hearings, which can be a shorter procedure.
                In Ireland, the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill was referred to the
                parliamentary Joint Committee on Health, which ran public hearings for key stakeholders.</p>
            <p>It may be unusual for the Health Ministry in some countries to run public consultations in
                respect of public health measures. Governments do not need to undertake a process for plain
                packaging that is outside of its normal constitutional requirements. It is also important to
                bear in mind that a poorly run public consultation, which does not allow effective responses
                or is a mere sham because the government has already made up its mind, can lead to
                greater legal problems than not running one at all.</p>

        <div class="content-desc-cont col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-blue-green">2. Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC</div>
            <p>“When seeking comments or submissions from tobacco companies, governments need to be careful
                to comply with Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC which stipulates that Parties shall act to
                protect tobacco-control policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco
                industry. Given that plain packaging involves technical regulations that impact on the way
                in which a product is manufactured, it can be important that those parts of industry that
                are impacted be allowed to have their input considered. They key to interaction with the
                industry is to be clear about exactly what issues comments are sought on and to ensure there
                is complete transparency in respect of any meeting or discussion.</p>
            <p>Tobacco companies can provide written submissions, which should then made publicly available.
                Meetings can take place but should be limited to where specific information is needed in
                relation to potential costs to industry or to technical drafting of the legislation which
                may impact on the manufacturing process in an unnecessary way. Where meetings do take place,
                full records should be made publicly available about the arrangements, who was present at
                the meeting and minutes of what was discussed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-desc-cont col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-blue-green">3. How should it be run?</div>
            <p>If a public consultation is run by the Health Ministry, sufficient time needs to be factored
                into the process to allow stakeholders to respond and also to allow the Health Ministry
                officials time to properly consider the submissions and any amendments to the legislation
                that flow from those submissions.</p>
            <p>Consultations on tobacco product plain packaging have generated huge volumes of responses
                because of campaigns funded by the tobacco industry on one side, and tobacco control
                advocacy groups on the other. This led to 650,000 responses to the first UK consultation –
                more than any previous public consultation. If resources are not available to consider huge
                numbers of responses, an alternative method of allowing key stakeholders to provide their
                submissions should be used that invites the key interested bodies or organizations to make
                submissions. A consultation is not a vote but a means of ensuring all relevant issues and
                views are considered.</p>
            <p>A decision must be taken as to the best stage to have stakeholder input, and this will depend
                on local circumstances. One option is to consult or take submissions on the principle of
                whether or not to proceed with the plain packaging, but it may be preferable to consult not
                on whether or not to proceed but on the detail of proposal.</p>

            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-blue-green"> 4. Key principles</div>
            <ul class="custom">
                <li>Set clear time frames — these need to be tailored to the specific country’s
                    circumstances. For the purposes of planning a legislative timetable, it is suggested that
                    a consultation run for a minimum of six weeks and that the time to review and consider the
                    responses be at least four weeks, although this is very dependent on how many responses are
                    received.
                </li>
                <li>Set clear parameters of the policy intentions and the questions that are being asked.
                </li>
                <li>Ensure that all relevant stakeholders have convenient access to the consultation
                    document and an efficient means of responding.
                </li>
                <li>Mobilize an alliance of health-orientated stakeholders to respond and to communicate
                    with the media.
                </li>
                <li>Do not commit to responding to individual submissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A consultation document also needs to be meaningful and provide stakeholders with sufficient
                information to respond. It is recommended that it includes the following:</p>
            <p>
            <ol class="custom list-style-none">
                <li>a. the existing tobacco-control measures already in place in the country;</li>
                <li>b. the current smoking prevalence and consumption rates and the costs and harms to
                    society they cause;
                </li>
                <li>d. a proposal that plain packaging of tobacco products be introduced (alongside any
                    other tobacco control measures that are being introduced at the same time);
                </li>
                <li>e. the aims and objectives of the policy (as described in <a
                            href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>getting-prepared/set-policy-objectives"><b
                                class="fc-blue-green">Guide 1.1</b></a>);
                </li>
                <li>f. a summary of the evidence base that supports the introduction of plain packaging (<a
                            href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>collecting-the-evidence/evidence-review"><b
                                class="fc-blue-green">Guide 2.1</a></b>);
                </li>
                <li>g. what the features the proposed legislation would include in sufficient detail to
                    allow comment (or a draft of the proposed legislation if that is available);
                </li>
                <li>h. the time frame that the government proposes;and</li>
