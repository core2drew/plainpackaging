            </p>
            <p>
                The tobacco industry have mounted well-funded and sophisticated campaigns opposing plain
                packaging of tobacco products in every country where the policy is taken forward by
                government. However, the arguments used by opponents of plain packaging are broadly similar
                in each country.
            </p>

            <p>
                Governments should take objections to plain packaging, and the veracity of them, into
                careful consideration when reviewing the evidence for the policy. Not doing so can lead to
                accusations of an unfair process. But officials can decide what weight or importance they
                give to these arguments and compare them to the evidence in support of the policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tobacco companies have also submitted lengthy responses to public consultations on plain
                packaging. These submissions provide the detail behind the arguments that headline in the
                media and are referred to though out these pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important for governments and civil society to mobilise support for tobacco plain
                packaging and part of that process involves countering the false or deceitful arguments of
                the tobacco industry. This means anticipating the likely arguments and directly refuting
                them.

                Big tobacco strongly argues that there is no reliable evidence to show that plain packaging
                will reduce smoking rates. The tobacco companies have used this argument in their
                advertising campaigns in Australia, the UK, France and elsewhere. It is part of the
                opposition in each jurisdiction that considers the policy.

                These industry campaigns make bold but simple assertions that are often then picked up and
                repeated in the media. The tobacco company submissions to the governments go into more
                detail. Their arguments fall into four broad categories:

            <ol>

                    Undermining or criticizing the supporting research evidence, by asserting it is all

                The four big tobacco companies have criticized the systematic evidence reviews — such as the
                Stirling Review, the Chantler Review, and the Hammond Review, detailed on the <b>RESEARCH

                    to the UK 2014 consultation</a>, Imperial Tobacco commented on the Chantler Review:
            </p>

            <p class='p-states'>
                “At its heart the Report relies on a selection of theoretical studies, including those in
                the ‘Systematic Review’ commissioned by the Department of Health from Public Health Research
                Consortium (“PHRC”), none of which have been able to show that standardised packaging would
                reduce smoking prevalence and which themselves have had to acknowledge their very
                significant limitations.” [p. 9]

                control advocates, are
                not reliable or convincing. The methodology is flawed. Not a single study can be pointed to
                in
                the Systematic Reviews which demonstrates that plain packaging is likely to achieve actual
                public health benefits. Furthermore, the individual surveys underlying the ‘systematic’

                test what people say they will do rather than what they actually do.”[p. 5]</p>

            <p>
                In their responses to consultations on plain packaging, tobacco companies have consistently
                stated that the real life evidence from Australia’s statistics on prevalence and consumption
                do
                not show any decline <i>attributable to plain packaging</i> and that countries should wait
                until
                the
                outcome of real life evidence from Australia.

                    to
                    the UK 2014 consultation</a>, Imperial Tobacco stated:
            </p>

            <p class="p-states">
                “The Australian Government is planning to conduct a review on the plain packaging
                implementation
                in December 2014 and we would expect other governments to wait until this review has been
                completed before making any policy decisions.”[p. 21]

                effective in achieving its original objectives of reducing smoking prevalence or
                consumption.”[p. 12]
            </p>

            <p>
                The tobacco company consultation submissions also highlight other statistics from Australia
                to
                seek to show that prevalence and consumption have not been affected by the introduction of
                plain
                packaging.

                reported
                increases in smoking prevalence after the implementation of plain packaging. Specifically,
                smoking prevalence in South Australia increased from 16.7% to 19.4% between 2012 and 2013.
                During the same period, smoking prevalence in Queensland and Western Australia went from
                14.3%

            <p>
                However, these state surveys use small sample sizes and, therefore, year on year, the
                changes in
                prevalence are not statistically significant. This issue was addressed in the PIR (see the

                The tobacco companies rely on academic studies both to criticize the supporting research

                to

                them

                These (and other industry-commissioned studies) claim that there was an existing downward
                trend
                in tobacco prevalence rates in Australia that would have continued even without plain
                packaging
                being introduced. A number of tobacco-control measures were introduced in Australia at a
                similar
                time to plain packaging, such as larger graphic health warnings and increases in excise tax.
                The
                analysis from these studies is that plain packaging did not increase the predicted trend in
                the
                rate of decrease in prevalence and, therefore, cannot be shown to have had any impact.

                2. Increases illicit tobacco
            </h3>

            <p>
                The tobacco industry relies heavily on its claim that plain packaging will increase the
                illicit trade in tobacco. The argument is one of the main issues raised in its media
                campaigns, in its submissions to government, and in its legal arguments before the courts.
                However, this claim lacks both logic and evidence. It is made in three ways:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Plain packs will be easier and cheaper to counterfeit than the existing complex branded
                    packs;
                </li>

                <li>
                    Smokers prefer branded packs and are more like to purchase illicit tobacco that has
                    branded packaging if legal tobacco is in plain packs; and
                </li>

                <li>
                    Illicit trade in tobacco has increased in Australia after the implementation of plain
                    packaging.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The tobacco industry commissions statistical data on the illicit trade in tobacco for many
                countries, often using the flawed “empty pack” survey method. In each country that has
                considered plain packaging, the tobacco companies promote media articles raising fears about
                illicit tobacco. Leaked internal documents from Philip Morris show this was a central pillar
                of their strategy to oppose the policy<sup>1</sup>
                Research shows that the tobacco industry uses inflated estimates of illicit
                trade.<sup>2</sup>
            </p>

            <img height="350px" class="img-responsive center-block"
                 src="<?php echo $base_url; ?>img/ref-j/Newspaper_coverage.jpg">
            <br>&nbsp;<br>
            <p>
                For example, in the UK, research has shown that in the two years before plain packaging
                proposals were announced, there were no media articles about the illicit trade in tobacco.
                In the two years after plain packaging was first proposed, 52 stories appeared in the media
                about rising rates of illicit tobacco, all of which cited tobacco industry data rather than
                the official government statistics, which showed the rates were declining. <sup>3</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                A similar situation occurred in Slovenia with many news articles raising concerns about
                smuggled cigarettes appearing during the period when the government was considering plain
                packaging.
                <sup>4</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                The industry then links these concerns about the illicit trade to argue against plain
                packaging laws. In some countries, tobacco companies have even produced short promotional
                films <sup>5</sup>
                that raise fears about crime and terrorism, which they say will result from plain packaging.<sup>6</sup>

                    These two very similar news articles are from Canada in 2016 and the UK in 2014. The
                    myth
                    that plain packaging of tobacco will increase illicit trade is promoted strongly by
                    the
                    tobacco industry, with no evidence to support the argument.

                    response</a> to the most recent consultation on plain packaging in Canada <sup>7</sup>
                provides a
                typical example of the industry arguments. It stated:
            </p>

            <p class="p-states">
                “In a plain pack environment, illegal producers will benefit at the expense of legitimate
                industry. They would be able to replicate easily plain packs and continue to supply the
                Canadian market with illegal branded packs and clear plastic baggies of cigarettes without
                health warnings. “ [p. 3]
            </p>

            <p>
                JTI’s submission relied only on industry funded, discredited data about the extent of
                contraband tobacco in Canada. It ignored the independent research and official data that
                shows the illicit market has decreased in recent years. <sup>8</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                JTI also asserted that plain packs will be easier to counterfeit [paragraph 148]. The only
                research cited is a report from 2012, commissioned by JTI, by Zimmerman and
                Chaudhary,<sup>9</sup>
                which
                has been the subject of academic criticism <sup>10</sup>. There is no independent
                peer-reviewed
                research
                to back up JTI’s argument.
            </p>

            <p>
                JTI also claims that:
            </p>

            <p class="p-states">
                “The level of illegal tobacco consumption in Australia has grown more than 20% since plain
                packaging was introduced.” [paragraph 149]
            </p>

            <p>
                To support this assertion JTI relied solely on data from a report by KPMG. That study uses
                an “empty pack” survey, which has been shown to have significant flaws in its methodology
                . <sup>12</sup>
                Even that KPMG survey has found no counterfeit plain packs over four years. KPMG has written
                to the UK Public Health Minister to state that the report has been “misrepresented by
                others, without our consent, to suggest it supports the contention that plain paper
                packaging could lead of itself to an increase in tobacco smuggling and duty avoidance.”
                <sup>13</sup>
                JTI
                ignored the official statistics and research that demonstrates the levels of illicit trade
                has remained constant (see below).

                    <b>Packaging features used to combat the illicit trade do not change under plain or
                        generic packaging legislation.</b> Enforcement procedures rely on covert (invisible)
                    codes
                    and tax stamps on genuine packs; neither of these is changed by plain packaging. In
                    addition, the legislation requires colorful picture health warnings so plain packs are
                    not literally “plain” and are no easier to counterfeit.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>
                        The demand for illicit tobacco is related to price and availability but not to
                        packaging. <sup>14</sup>
                    </b>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Keeping promotional branding and trademarks on packs does not make counterfeiting
                        more
                        difficult.</b> Counterfeiters are able to copy the existing branded packaging
                    easily. Even
                    Philip Morris has stated that, <i>“[Cigarette packs] are easily counterfeited, despite
                        the
                        inclusion of innovative holograms, special inks and elaborate design details.
                        Evidence
                        shows that counterfeiters can make copies of even the most sophisticated paper
                        stamps in
                        three weeks.”</i> <sup>15</sup> Because plain packs retain the picture health
                    warning, tax
                    stamps, and
                    covert markings, there is little difference in how difficult they are to counterfeit.

                    involvement of the tobacco industry in this large-scale fraud is well documented,
                    through the industry’s internal documents, their own admissions, and court judgments.

                3. Leads to lower tobacco prices
            </h3>

            <p>
                The tobacco companies argue that plain packaging will commoditize tobacco, meaning that the
                only way to compete is on price which will lead to price reductions which in turn will then
                lead to increased demand.

                Lower Tobacco Prices
            </p>

            <p>
                A number of the “unintended consequences” suggested by the tobacco industry center on the
                assertion that standardized packaging would cause tobacco product prices to drop, especially
                in the premium segment of the market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tobacco companies have, for many years, invested in building premium brands, for which
                consumers are willing to pay more. The tobacco industry say that, with plain packaging,
                smokers would no longer be willing to make purchasing decisions based on a brand identity,
                with premium brands having the greatest to lose.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tobacco companies claim that, where branding cannot be used, this will lead to increased
                price competition instead (sometimes referred to as “commoditization”), which will lead to
                lower-priced tobacco products. Lower-cost tobacco leads to increased demand. The tobacco
                companies use this argument to suggest that plain packaging will actually increase smoking
                rates (or reduce the rate of decline).

            </p>
            <p class="p-states">
                In a plain packaging environment, it will become ever more difficult to sell products in
                the
                premium segments. When all packs look virtually identical and physically feel exactly
                the
                same,
                smokers will be more unwilling to pay a higher price for our premium products. [para

                Downtrading
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, each of the tobacco companies has said that they believe that there would, in
                time, be increased “<b>downtrading</b>” (or brand switching), whereby smokers choose to
                purchase
                lower priced brands instead of more expensive premium brands as a result of plain packaging.
                If there is less perceived ‘”status’” to be gained from identifying as a consumer of a
                high-end brand, which may be the case if tobacco packs were standardized, some say that
                smokers will switch to cheaper alternatives and price would become the key way to
                differentiate between products.
            </p>

            <p>
                This, they claim, would mean that overall, the price of purchased tobacco would be lower and
                that downtrading stimulates demand.

            <p>
                In the tobacco companies’ legal challenge to the UK plain packaging regulations, the
                companies submitted expert evidence, <sup>1</sup> which they claimed demonstrated that
                plain
                packaging
                would increase smoking rates (or would reduce the existing downward trend of those rates).
                That expert evidence included lengthy and complex economic analysis. Fundamental to these
                economic models was the assumption that plain packaging will significantly increase
                downtrading.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Two issues at the <i>core</i> of the tobacco industry’s legal case that plain packaging
                    is a
                    disproportionate measure are that it will increase illicit trade and increase
                    downtrading.</b>
                The judge in the UK case rejected these arguments, stating not only had the government
                proved its case but also that the evidence submitted by the tobacco companies had
                fundamental methodological flaws. <sup>2</sup>

                tobacco companies have brought legal challenges against plain packaging laws in national,
                regional, and international courts and tribunals. <i>All of these have so far been

            <p>
                In the cases that were dismissed in the UK and French administrative courts, the tobacco
                companies argued that plain packaging breaches national trademark law; breaches rights, such
                as freedom of expression and freedom to conduct a business; and violates a number of the
                World Trade Organization agreements, intellectual property treaties, and regional free trade

            <p>
                Despite all these cases being firmly rejected, the tobacco companies continue to strongly
                assert that plain packaging is unlawful in their media campaigns and in submissions to

                5. Negative impacts on small retailers
            </h3>
            <p>
                Big tobacco argues that plain packaging will negatively impact small retailers and that it
                will increase transaction times for serving tobacco.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Australia, the UK, and France, the tobacco companies argued that plain packaging would
                have negative impacts on small retailers. The industry regularly provides funds to national
                retailer associations <sup>1</sup>, and those associations then oppose tobacco control
                regulation.
            </p>

            <p>
                For instance, in Australia, a study commissioned by the Alliance of Australian Retailers
                (AAR) concluded that:
            </p>

            <p class="p-states">
                “retailing times would be adversely affected if standardised packaging were introduced by an
                additional 15 to 45 seconds per transaction and that the effect would be particularly
                significant for smaller retailers.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The AAR set up a website to oppose plain packaging (a screen shot is shown below). However,
                the AAR was a tobacco industry front group financed by Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, and
                British American Tobacco (BAT). Internal tobacco industry and AAR documents that were leaked
                to the media revealed that the Alliance was set up and run by the tobacco industry to lobby
                against plain packaging <sup>2</sup>. This is an example of Astroturfing, a campaign
                pretending to
                be a
                grassroots initiative, while hiding its true origin, goal, and funding.

                Similarly, in the UK, the tobacco industry funded a campaign run by the Tobacco Retailers
                Alliance that claimed to be a “coalition of 26,000 independent shopkeepers,” but which was
                established by the industry to oppose tobacco-control measures. ,<sup>3</sup>

                    to the UK 2012 consultation</a> on plain packaging stated that:
            </p>

            <p class="indented italic">
                “plain packaging will have significant negative effects on retailers. <u>Transaction times
                    will
                    increase</u>. Margins will be eroded by further downtrading. As tobacco products make up
                a
                significant proportion of the turnover of many small retailers, plain packaging may have
                significant cash-flow and credit implications for them.”

                    Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN)</a>, which receives funds from the tobacco
                industry, also made submissions to that consultation. It went even further by arguing that
                plain packaging will:
            </p>

            <p class="p-states">
                “significantly increase transaction times and costs in shops as it will take staff twice as
                long to retail tobacco products and worryingly, it will significantly increase retailers’
                vulnerability to crime while they are increasingly distracted retailing tobacco
                products.” <sup>4

            </p>

            <p>
                The NFRN was extremely vocal in its opposition to plain packaging and produced postcards
                that were placed in retail outlets across the UK with misleading images of white plain
                packs, suggesting that plain packaging legislation will lead to increases in illicit trade,
                organized crime and terrorism, loss of tax revenue, and more children smoking:. <sup>5</sup>

                However, the strong evidence from Australia is that plain packaging has had no real impact
                on small retailers. This may be the reason why this argument was not used by either JTI or
                Imperial Tobacco in their consultation responses to the Canadian 2016 consultation.

                Will lead to plain packaging of other products the slippery slope / domino effect
            </h3>

            <p>
                A key argument used in the tobacco industry media campaigns in many countries is that if
                plain packaging for tobacco is introduced, it sets a precedent for other consumer products,
                such as soft drinks, alcohol, or fatty foods. The argument is that plain packaging is a step
                too far towards a “nanny state” and will lead to reduced product innovation across all
                sectors. In this way, the tobacco industry tries to get support from the other industries in
                opposing the policy generally.
            </p>

            <p>
                This argument is often put forward in campaigns and media articles by third-party
                organizations, posing as independent voices but which receive funding from the tobacco
                industry.
            </p>

            <p>
                For instance, in the UK, the “<a href="http://www.handsoffourpacks.com/">Hands Off Our
                    Packs</a>” campaign, run by
                <a href="http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/Forest">FOREST</a>, strongly pushed
                this argument forward. The Institute for Economic Affairs, a libertarian think tank, hosted
                events and published papers opposing plain packaging, using the slippery slope argument. It
                was an issue regularly cited in media articles about those that oppose plain packaging.
                <sup>1</sup>
                Imperial Tobacco UK also deployed the slippery slope argument in an anti-plain packaging
                <a href="">YouTube video</a> advert in Britain — 2020 Vision. <sup>2</sup> The advert
                misleadingly
                suggests that by 2020
                all products perceived to be unhealthy will be sold in plain packaging. The advert was
                promoted through the distribution of leaflets on petrol forecourts.

                In Sweden, the UK, and Canada, the tobacco industry, or groups opposing the plain packaging
                of tobacco, have even set up whole fake shops as media stunts, where all the products, such
                as drink, crisps, coffee, etc., are in mock plain packaging with health warnings. The images
                above are from a convenience store converted by Students for Freedom (a libertarian campaign

                7. Job losses in the local tobacco industry
            </h3>

            <p>The tobacco industry claims that plain packaging will cause job losses in domestic tobacco
                manufacturing or packaging industries</p>
            <p>
                This argument is used against all tobacco-control measures in those countries that have
                domestic tobacco production or manufacturing. However, overall economic benefits for a
                country in reducing smoking rates are huge and far outweigh any costs to the industry.

                <b>BAT threatens to leave Chile:</b> In 2015, BAT threatened to stop operations in Chile
                when the
                national legislature was considering a bill designed to strengthen tobacco-control measures,
                including plain packaging. <sup>1</sup> Movement on the bill stalled, but the company
                closed several
                factories anyway. However, BAT Chile maintains critical manufacturing facilities in the
                country. It exports cigarettes to seventeen countries around the world. <sup>2</sup> The
                decision to
                close some factories in Chile can be interpreted as a decision to consolidate based on cost
                efficiency and not on local tobacco-control laws.

            <p>
                <b>In Canadain 1994–95:</b>During the campaign for plain packaging, the specter of job
                losses in
                the tobacco growing, manufacturing, and packaging sectors was often raised by opponents.
                Representatives of both Ontario and Quebec growers stated that plain packaging would
                intensify price competition, causing tobacco firms to move their manufacturing facilities
                outside Canada. Plain packaging was dropped at that time, but most of the jobs in the
                tobacco industry were lost anyway. Imperial Tobacco moved all production to Mexico,
                tobacco-crop production has dropped 87% and tobacco packaging firms have downsized in
                Canada. <sup>3</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>In the UK:</b> A report commissioned by Philip Morris claimed that plain packaging would
                lead to
                between 2,000 and 3,500 jobs lost in the convenience retailing sector, thanks purely to the
                decrease in revenue through tobacco sales. It claimed a further 2,250 to 3,850 jobs were
                expected to be lost in the tobacco manufacturing sector, despite a rise in tobacco
                consumption. <sup>4</sup>

            <p>
                In <a href="http://www.jti.com/files/4013/4149/4323/Packaging_Response.pdf">JTI’s submission
                    the UK 2012 consultation</a>, it argued that:

                “Plain packaging will have a direct impact on investment, trade and jobs. JTI and other
                manufacturers support 5,700 jobs directly and 66,000 indirectly in the UK, and tobacco
                generates £12.1 billion in revenue each year for the Government.” [p. 3]

                industry's tactics against plain packaging in Australia, and outlined how “The industry
                hides behind a libertarian cloak, complaining that Australia is an over-regulated ‘nanny
                state’ that will suffer job losses and further hardship if more regulation such as plain
                packaging is required by law.” <sup>5</sup> However, even when BAT announced the closure
                of its
                manufacturing facility in Australia in 2015, it specifically stated that plain packaging was
                <i>not the reason for the closure.</i> <sup>6</sup>

                    </b>
                    The tobacco industry constitutes a very small fraction of overall production and
                    employment in most countries. Equally important to note is that the number of jobs that
                    depend on tobacco has been falling in most countries, owing to such things as
                    technological innovation and globalization. For most countries, tobacco-control measures
                    will have only a modest impact on employment and will not lead to net job losses.

                    productivity losses, is more than $1.4 trillion per year — 1.8% of the world GDP — with
                    the burden increasingly being carried by developing countries. <sup>8</sup> Any loss

                    <b>Global tobacco production is dominated by multinational corporations that have been

                    and
                    manufacturing facilities where costs are lowest. Thus, decisions are based on global
                    economic factors and not by strong local tobacco-control policies. For example, when
                    Japan Tobacco International closed its last production facility in the United Kingdom,
                    it also closed facilities in Belgium and Germany and moved production to Poland and

                    has been
                    ongoing for years in high-income countries since the 1950s, owing to steady declines in
                    smoking. <sup>12</sup> Studies show that most countries see no net job losses and that

                    falling,
                    tobacco company profits still continue to rise. The companies increase their prices,
                    over and above any tax rises, and so still increase profits. <sup>14</sup>

                    profits
                    rose by 30%. <sup>15</sup> This was as a result of price increases in all sectors of
                    the tobacco
                    market, <sup>16</sup> and from cost cutting, which included relocating production to
                    low-cost
                    economies. BAT Australia’s statement on the closure of its factory in 2014 confirmed
                    that it was due to production costs and that plain packaging was not a factor.

                8. Violates intellectual property protections
            </h3>

            <p>
                With this argument, the tobacco industry tries to suggest that plain packaging of tobacco
                products will somehow fundamentally undermine the system of protections for intellectual
                property and lead to a lack of confidence from business and investors.

                “The introduction of plain packaging will hugely undermine the protection of intellectual
                property rights and branding in Ireland. Going this route will introduce a fundamental

                9. There are alternative less restrictive measures therefore plain packaging is unnecessary
            </h3>

            <p>
                The tobacco companies make this argument because it is important for some of the legal tests
                on the justification or proportionality of a regulatory measure. For instance, under Article
                2.2 of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade agreement, a technical measure should “not be
                more trade-restrictive than <i>necessary</i> to fulfil a legitimate objective.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The legal test as to whether or not a measure is <i>necessary</i> involves considering if
                there are
                less restrictive alternatives that would have an equal effect in achieving the public health
                objective
            </p>

            <p>
                The tobacco companies all argue that there are less restrictive measures than plain
                packaging. The alternatives the companies put forward as being effective and proportionate
                solutions include:
            </p>

                    Increasing taxation.

            </ul>

            <p>
                Many of the tobacco company consultation submissions listed here include the position that
                these alternative measures should be introduced instead of plain packaging and that they
                would be more effective at reducing smoking rates and would be less restrictive on trade and
                intellectual property rights.
            </p>

            <p>
                These arguments were also included in the legal challenges to plain packaging regulations in
                the UK and France.
            </p>

            <p>
                For instance, in the <a

                    Court judgment from the UK</a>:
            </p>

            <p class="p-states">
                “The Claimants submit that the Secretary of State has failed to prove that standardised
                packaging is proportionate because the evidence does not show that there are no equally
                effective but less restrictive alternatives …“The Claimants submit that the Secretary of
                State has failed to prove that standardised packaging is proportionate because <u>the
                    evidence
                    does not show that there are no equally effective but less restrictive alternatives</u>
                …

                <br/>

                PMI contends that there is a less restrictive and more effective alternative policy
                available to the Government, <u>namely taxation . . . . They rely upon the expert evidence
                    of
                    Professor Mulligan who argued that taxation was a tobacco control policy “that obviously
                    works”</u> . . . . This is “. . . all the Court needs to know to conclude that
                standardised
                packaging is unlawful: there is a less restrictive and more effective policy alternative
                available.”
            </p>

            <p>
                It is notable that, in the context of plain packaging, the tobacco companies argue that
                higher taxation, even in an already high tax market, is a policy that “obviously works” to
                reduce smoking rates. Where the tobacco companies seek to resist tax increases they argue
                the opposite.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also notable is that in court PMI, JTI and Imperial all abandoned any reliance on
                alternative measures being effective other than taxation. Only BAT continued to argue that
                in addition to tax, numerous alterative, less restrictive and equally effective measures
                could be introduced.

                10. Branding on packs does not cause
                people to start smoking

                The tobacco companies claim that branding on packs does not impact smoking initiation or
                overall consumption — it only affects “brand switching” and market share. For more detail on

            </h3>

            <p>
                The tobacco companies seek to blur the overwhelming view of marketing theory and evidence
                that advertising affects overall consumption of a product. This despite all the internal
                tobacco industry documents to the contrary (see theTobacco Branding pageof the Tools and
                Resources).
            </p>

            <p>
                Tobacco companies argue that branding only promotes brand switching by current smokers and
                has no effect on overall primary demand. They say that even a small amount of brand
                switching is worth a lot of money to them. However, cigarette brands enjoy the highest brand
                loyalty of all consumer products, with fewer than 10 percent changing brands annually. Brand
                choices are usually made early in the life of a smoker, with a high concordance between
                brand first smoked and the brand eventually selected as a usual brand. Thus, once a smoker
                embraces a cigarette brand, it is quite unlikely that they will change.

                The tobacco companies also made these arguments in their legal challenge to the plain
                packaging laws in the UK. In his judgment dismissing the claim, the judge noted that:
            </p>

            <p class="p-states">
                “The tobacco industry has sought to argue, in these proceedings and in others, that all of
                its marketing activity, including packaging, aims solely to persuade existing adult smokers
                to switch brands rather than to persuade people (including in particular children) to take
                up smoking.” <sup>5</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                In their submission to the Norway consultation, JTI also sought to argue that tobacco
                packaging does not influence smoking behavior. The company argued that packaging and
                advertising are not the same and should not be conflated. It claims that fundamental
                marketing theory shows that in a “mature market,” such as in Norway (where growth has slowed
                and awareness of the product is universal), marketing is not to persuade non-users to try
                the product but to persuade existing users to swap brands. They argue that branding promotes
                brands not the act of smoking. <sup>6</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                Tobacco companies have been making this argument about the role of advertising in mature
                markets for nearly three decades to seek to prevent any restrictions on tobacco advertising.
                It is noted in the US Surgeon General’s report that, at a congressional hearing in 1989, an
                industry spokesperson claimed that the function of advertising in a mature market “is to
                promote brand loyalty or brand switching.” <sup>7</sup> Even then it was highlighted
                that textbooks
                state
                that when faced with a so-called mature market, advertising firms can and often should
                attempt to both increase usage among existing customers and to address potential new
                users. <sup>8</sup>
                The surgeon general also pointed out that the strongest indicator that tobacco companies
                must seek out large numbers of new users stems from the feature of the tobacco market that
                millions of its customers die every year and millions more quit. The only way to maintain
                the mature market is to recruit new users.
