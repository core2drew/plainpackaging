            <p>The tobacco industry has a long track record of using legal challenges to prevent or delay
                governments’ tobacco control measures. Countries that were early adopters of plain packaging
                laws have faced legal challenges in domestic and regional courts, in international
                investment arbitration tribunals and under the World Trade Organisation dispute settlement
                procedures. <b>All the legal challenges decided, as of the end of 2016, have upheld the
                    legality of plain packaging of tobacco products.</b></p>
            <p>The key message is that if plain packaging of tobacco products is adopted using appropriate
                domestic constitutional, administrative and legislative arrangements then there is no
                inherent reason why plain packaging should be found unlawful. However, this toolkit can only
                provide generalized legal information taking into account the academic literature and the
                results of legal challenges that have already been decided across different jurisdictions.
                To protect the policy in the face of legal challenge it is important to undertake the
                appropriate processes and sound legal drafting. The procedural steps and drafting advice set
                out in this toolkit should provide a good grounding for the administrative processes and
                legislative drafting needed to secure a robust plain packaging law.</p>

                    Constitutional requirements and the priority given to different rights and obligations
                    in national legal jurisprudence vary from country to country. Therefore it is important
                    that a country specific legal analysis (by internal government lawyers and/or through an
                    opinion from external lawyers) is undertaken on the legal issues raised by plain
                    packaging. Given the possibility of legal challenge and the likely threats and
                    allegations that will be made by the industry if the measure is proposed, it is a
                    sensible precaution to have ready answers to the legal issues that will be raised.

            <p>The tobacco industry continues to aggressively assert that plain packaging is unlawful in
                countries considering the policy, even though industry legal challenges have all so far been
                defeated in Australia, the UK, France and the European Union. There are similar broad themes
                to the legal arguments used by the industry across jurisdictions. They are that plain
                packaging:</p>
            <ul class="custom">
                <li>Is an expropriation/deprivation of property;</li>
                <li>Is an unreasonable, dis-proportionate or unnecessary measure, because it is not
                    justified by the evidence;
                </li>
                <li>Is adopted without due process or in an arbitrary manner;</li>
                <li>Breaches rights to freedom of expression and to run a business</li>
                <li>Is incompatible with intellectual property laws and the ‘right to use’ a trademark</li>
                <li>Breaches international obligations under World Trade Organisation rules and investment
                    treaties.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These issues may arise out of domestic laws or constitutions, regional obligations or
                international law. More explanation of these issues is set in the <a

            <p>These rulings express legal principles and decisions that will be of value to lawyers in
                other jurisdictions that may have to defend plain packaging in their own countries. The
                judgments also contain clear and concise passages that will help policy makers and civil
                society organizations to provide information about the policy or promote its implementation.
                These are explored in more detail in the <a

                but here are some highlights:</p>
            <ul class="custom">
                <li>Plain packaging requirements “are no different in kind from any legislation that
                    requires labels that warn against the use or misuse of a product.” <sup>1</sup></li>
                <li>“[The tobacco companies’] body of expert evidence does not accord with internationally
                    recognised best practice.” <sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>“In my judgment the qualitative evidence relied upon by the [Government] is cogent,
                    substantial and overwhelmingly one-directional in its conclusion” <sup>3</sup></li>
                <li>“[WTO] TRIPS and the FCTC can be read together without any risk of them colliding or
                    being mutually inconsistent” <sup>4</sup></li>
                <li>Trademarks provide “a right of use that exists vis-à-vis other persons, an exclusive
                    right, but a relative one. It is not an absolute right to use that can be asserted
                    against the State.” <sup>6</sup></li>
                <li>“Manufacturers and distributors of harmful products such as cigarettes can have no
                    expectation that new and more onerous regulations will not be imposed” <sup>5</sup></li>
