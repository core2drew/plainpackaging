                <p>
                    These campaigns oppose plain packaging in every country that has proposed or considered
                    the policy. These campaigns go much further than the typical opposition to tobacco
                    control measures. With plain packaging, the industry campaigns have used:
                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>full page advertisements in national newspapers</li>
                    <li>billboard campaigns,</li>
                    <li>dedicated websites setup to promulgate the tobacco industry’s views,</li>
                    <li>social media,</li>
                    <li>short films,</li>
                    <li>strong political lobbying at all levels,</li>
                    <li>street level campaigning and surveys,</li>
                    <li>heavy use of proxy organisations or front groups , and</li>
                    <li>in Sweden, JTI even set up a whole fake super market at a political convention,
                        where all the goods (coffee, bread, milk etc.) were in plain packaging.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>These campaigns have the potential to be effective in swaying public opinion and some
                    parts of government. <b>The reason the tobacco industry is so vehemently opposed to
                        plain packaging is because the policy works.</b></p>

                <p>The tobacco industry’s arguments opposing plain packaging are now well established and
                    vary little from one country to another although the focus can be different. For
                    instance in France, the tobacco retailers (backed by the industry) generated much of the
                    opposition with the argument that it would lead to job losses. Where as in Slovenia, the
                    argument that it would increase illicit trade and fund criminal gangs was used more. But
                    the industry has no hesitation in recycling arguments in multiple jurisdictions, even
                    after they have been wholly discredited elsewhere.</p>

                    speak with the media. Organisations can pre-empt the tobacco industry opposition by
                    engaging with the media ahead of any government announcement to provide the real facts

                    steps that shaped the successful campaign including sending flashy cigarette packs to

                <p>The tobacco companies regularly say different things in different contexts. Highlighting
                    this can be an effective means of countering their arguments. For instance, in the
                    industry challenge to the UK regulations, the tobacco companies sought to argue that
                    branding on packaging is not the same as advertising and has a different function.
                    However, in the challenge before the High Court of Australia, the tobacco companies made
                    a direct comparison between the space on the packets for branding and advertising
                    billboards (<i>see the</i> <a
                        href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>legal-issues-and-international-developments/legal-issues"><b
                            class="fc-violet">Reference Section K: LEGAL ISSUES AND CASE
                            SUMMARIES</b></a>).</p>
                <p>Another example of this relates to illicit trade. Philip Morris International claimed
                    that branded packaging is difficult or impossible to counterfeit when arguing against
                    plain packaging but at the same time confirmed that branded packaging is easy to
                    counterfeit in a 2012 brochure on Codentify (a track and trace system developed by PMI).
                    A report by KPMG into illicit tobacco in Australia commissioned by Philip Morris Limited
                    confirms that there have been no counterfeit plain packs identified since
                    implementation. The KPMG report is the only statistical evidence the industry uses to
                    support its contention that plain packaging increases illicit trade but the methodology
                    is so flawed that the industry did not use it (or any other evidence) to support that
                    argument in its legal challenge to UK plain packaging regulations.</p>

                <p><b>FRONT GROUPS.</b> The tobacco industry regularly establish and finance front groups or
                    co-opt third party organisations such as think tanks or libertarian groups, often via
                    public relations agencies, which are then used to give the impression of broad support
                    for the opposing arguments. For instance when plain packaging was proposed in Australia,
                    a front group was established, which claimed only to represent the retail industry.
                    However, internal documentation about this group and other industry counter measures
                    were leaked to the media, revealing that the group was receiving support from several
                    tobacco companies.<sup>10</sup></p>

                <p>In the UK, a university study showed three-quarters of the organisations outside the
                    industry had direct financial links to one or more of the big four tobacco companies and
                    these were responsible for 60% of the anti-plain packaging campaigning identified. The
                    study, found that organisations which actively opposed plain packaging (including
                    campaigners and business groups) rarely reported any relationship with tobacco companies
                    transparently<sup>11</sup>.</p>
                <p><b>SOPHISTICATED AND WELL PLANNED CAMPAIGNS</b>. In 2013 leaked internal tobacco industry
                    documents, including power points, revealed the inner-workings of Philip Morris
                    International’s (P M I) anti-Plain Packaging campaign in the UK during the previous
                    year. The two examples of slides shown below demonstrate P M I ’s key media messages and
                    the sophisticated and detailed timeline planning of which arguments to use and when.
