                <p>
                    These campaigns oppose plain packaging in every country that has proposed or considered
                    the policy. These campaigns go much further than the typical opposition to tobacco-control
                    measures. With plain packaging, the industry campaigns have used:
                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>full-page advertisements in national newspapers</li>
                    <li>billboard campaigns</li>
                    <li>dedicated websites setup to promulgate the tobacco industry’s views</li>
                    <li>social media</li>
                    <li>short films</li>
                    <li>strong political lobbying at all levels</li>
                    <li>street-level campaigning and surveys</li>
                    <li>heavy use of proxy organizations or front groups , and</li>
                    <li>in Sweden, JTI even set up a whole fake super market at a political convention,
                        where all the goods (coffee, bread, milk, etc.) were in plain packaging
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>These campaigns have the potential to be effective in swaying public opinion and some
                    parts of government. The reason the tobacco industry is so vehemently opposed to
                    plain packaging is because the policy works.</p>

                <p>The tobacco industry’s arguments opposing plain packaging are now well established and
                    vary little from one country to another, although the focus can be different. For
                    instance, in France, the tobacco retailers (backed by the industry) generated much of the
                    opposition with the argument that it would lead to job losses. Where as in Slovenia, the
                    argument that it would increase illicit trade and fund criminal gangs was used more. But
                    the industry has no hesitation in recycling arguments in multiple jurisdictions, even
                    after they have been wholly discredited elsewhere.</p>

                <p>The tobacco companies regularly say different things in different contexts. Highlighting
                    this can be an effective means of countering their arguments. For instance, in the
                    industry challenge to the UK regulations, the tobacco companies sought to argue that
                    branding on packaging is not the same as advertising and has a different function.
                    However, in the challenge before the High Court of Australia, the tobacco companies made
                    a direct comparison between the space on the packets for branding and advertising
                    billboards (<i>see the</i> <a

                <p>Another example of this relates to illicit trade. Philip Morris International claimed
                    that branded packaging is difficult or impossible to counterfeit when arguing against
                    plain packaging but at the same time, confirmed that branded packaging is easy to
                    counterfeit in a 2012 brochure on Codentify (a track-and trace-system developed by <span
                            class="font10">PMI</span>).
                    A report by into illicit tobacco in Australia commissioned by Philip Morris Limited
                    confirms that no counterfeit plain packs have been identified since
                    implementation. The <span class="font10">KPMG</span> report is the only statistical evidence the
                    industry uses to
                    support its contention that plain packaging increases illicit trade but the methodology
                    was so flawed that the industry did not use it (or any other evidence) to support that
                    argument in its legal challenge to UK plain packaging regulations.</p>

                <p><b>FRONT GROUPS.</b> The tobacco industry regularly establishes and finances front groups or
                    co-opts third-party organizations, such as think tanks or libertarian groups, often via
                    public relations agencies, which are then used to give the impression of broad support
                    for the opposing arguments. For instance, when plain packaging was proposed in Australia,
                    a front group was established, which claimed only to represent the retail industry.
                    However, internal documentation about this group and other industry counter measures
                    were leaked to the media, revealing that the group was receiving support from several
                    tobacco companies.<sup>10</sup></p>

                <p>In the UK, a university study showed three-quarters of the organizations outside the
                    industry had direct financial links to one or more of the big four tobacco companies, and
                    these were responsible for 60% of the anti-plain packaging campaigning identified. The
                    study, found that organizations that actively opposed plain packaging (including
                    campaigners and business groups) rarely reported any relationship with tobacco companies
                    transparently.<sup>11</sup></p>
