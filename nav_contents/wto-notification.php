                the technical barriers to trade agreement
            </div>
            <p>To avoid accusations that a government has failed to notify a relevant standard, it is
                recommended that plain packaging legislation is notified to the World Trade Organisations
                (WTO) under Technical Barriers to Trade (T B T ) Article 2.9. This is a procedural process
                that allows other governments to comment on a technical requirement and does not mean that
                plain packaging of tobacco products breaches any of the WTO agreements.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the TBT Agreement is to avoid unnecessary regulatory obstacles to
                international trade while <b>allowing for the regulatory autonomy of states to protect
                    legitimate public interests such as public health.</b> Article 2.9 obliges WTO member to
                notify drafts of technical regulations that could impact on international trade and which
                are not international standards, so that other WTO members can consider the regulations and
                make comments.</p>
            <p>A technical regulation is defined as being a regulation that: <i>“lays down product
                    characteristics or their related processes and production methods. Compliance is
                    mandatory. They may also deal with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking and
                    labelling requirements.”</i></p>
            <p><b>Plain packaging falls within the definition of a technical regulation</b> that relates to
                the trade in goods and is one that has not as yet been established as an international
                standard.</p>

                legislation
            </div>
            <p>This means that it should be at a stage which sets out the detail of what the government
                intends to adopt but is still capable of amendment. The W T O T B T procedure then requires
                <b>a 60 day stand still period</b> during which the legislative adoption process is frozen
                so that written comments from other WTO members can be sent on the draft measure. <b>This
                    period must be factored into the legislative timetable.</b></p>
            <p>There is also a requirement under Article 2.9 that the final adopted measure be published and
                it is recommended that there is a 6 month period between publication and coming into
                force.</p>

            <p><b>Most governments have a single agency or department that administers all the country’s
                    notifications.</b> But the Ministry of Health responsible for plain packaging will need
                to coordinate with that other department or agency to enable the notification to be made
                effectively.</p>

            <p>Many of these notifications received comments from other member countries in T B T committee
                meetings. Some countries, including those that brought a WTO dispute procedure against
                Australia (such as Indonesia, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Honduras) and some tobacco
                producing countries (such as Malawi, Zimbabwe and Nicaragua), have given negative comments
                to the committees; but many countries including New Zealand, Norway, Canada, Uruguay and the
                EU also provided positive comments supporting the position that plain packaging does not
                breach the WTO agreements and is a legitimate public health measure. In a number of
                committee meetings where Member State’s proposals for plain packaging were discussed, a
                representative of the World Health Organisation provided support for the measure and
                stressed that there is a strong body of evidence to support the position that plain
                packaging will achieve its objectives<sup>1</sup>.</p>
            <p>None of these comments in committee have led to further dispute procedures being commenced
                against any country that has adopted plain packaging laws, other than Australia.</p>

                Australia’s plain packaging laws
            </div>
            <p>At the time of writing, a WTO dispute settlement panel is adjudicating complaints by Cuba,
                the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Indonesia with respect to Australia’s plain packaging
                laws. It has been widely reported that British American Tobacco and Philip Morris are
                providing funding and legal support for Honduras and Dominican Republic in the
                proceedings.</p>
            <p>The panel’s decision is expected not before May 2017.</p>
            <p>There are well established principles and rules that demonstrate the flexibility for WTO
                Members to regulate for public health. These are described in the WHO publication on plain
                packaging of tobacco products2 and are set out briefly in in <a
                    href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>legal-issues-and-international-developments/legal-issues"><b

                        class="fc-yellow-gold">POLICY BRIEFING PAPERS</b></a> in the Reference
                Materials. The main issues of dispute fall under Article 2.2 of the T B T Agreement and
                Article 20 of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS).</p>
            <p>The WTO panel decision may be the subject of an appeal by the Parties but in the meantime it
                appears unlikely that any further dispute will arise concerning plain packaging laws of
                other WTO Members until that dispute is fully resolved.</p>
            <p><b>The issues in this dispute are separate from the procedural requirement to notify
                    regulations under TBT Article 2.9.</b></p>
