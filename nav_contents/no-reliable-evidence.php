                    Big tobacco strongly argues that there is no reliable evidence to show that plain packaging
                    will reduce smoking rates. The tobacco companies have used this argument in their
                    advertising campaigns in Australia, the UK, France and elsewhere. It is part of the
                    opposition in each jurisdiction that considers the policy.

                    These industry campaigns make bold but simple assertions that are often then picked up and
                    repeated in the media. The tobacco company submissions to the governments go into more
                    detail. Their arguments fall into four broad categories:

                    The four big tobacco companies have criticized the systematic evidence reviews — such as the
                    Stirling Review, the Chantler Review, and the Hammond Review, detailed on the <b>RESEARCH
                        EVIDENCE</b> page of the Tools and Resources.

                <p class='p-states'>
                    “At its heart the Report relies on a selection of theoretical studies, including those in
                    the ‘Systematic Review’ commissioned by the Department of Health from Public Health Research
                    Consortium (“PHRC”), none of which have been able to show that standardised packaging would
                    reduce smoking prevalence and which themselves have had to acknowledge their very
                    significant limitations.” [p. 9]

                    the Systematic Reviews which demonstrates that plain packaging is likely to achieve actual
                    public health benefits. Furthermore, the individual surveys underlying the ‘systematic’

                    test what people say they will do rather than what they actually do.”[p. 5]</p>

                <p>
                    In their responses to consultations on plain packaging, tobacco companies have consistently
                    stated that the real life evidence from Australia’s statistics on prevalence and consumption
                    do
                    not show any decline <i>attributable to plain packaging</i> and that countries should wait
                    until
                    the
                    outcome of real life evidence from Australia.

                    smoking prevalence in South Australia increased from 16.7% to 19.4% between 2012 and 2013.
                    During the same period, smoking prevalence in Queensland and Western Australia went from

                    However, these state surveys use small sample sizes and, therefore, year on year, the

                    trend
                    in tobacco prevalence rates in Australia that would have continued even without plain
                    packaging
                    being introduced. A number of tobacco-control measures were introduced in Australia at a
                    similar
                    time to plain packaging, such as larger graphic health warnings and increases in excise tax.
                    The
                    analysis from these studies is that plain packaging did not increase the predicted trend in
                    the
                    rate of decrease in prevalence and, therefore, cannot be shown to have had any impact.

                        The High Court challenge against the UK Regulations was the first (and as yet only)
                        legal challenge that addressed the evidence on both sides in detail (see 4.2.1). The
                        400-page judgment of Mr Justice Green goes to considerable length to assess this
                        evidence.

                    He was then scathing in his criticism of the evidence put forward by the tobacco companies
                    because it was not peer reviewed, either ignored or airily dismissed the worldwide research
                    and literature base, and was frequently unverifiable. He made detailed critiques of each of
                    the
                    <b>expert reports put forward by the tobacco companies and concluded that this “body of
