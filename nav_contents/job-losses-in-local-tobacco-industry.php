                </div>

                <p>The tobacco industry claims that plain packaging will cause job losses in domestic tobacco
                    manufacturing or packaging industries</p>
                <p>
                    This argument is used against all tobacco-control measures in those countries that have
                    domestic tobacco production or manufacturing. However, overall economic benefits for a
                    country in reducing smoking rates are huge and far outweigh any costs to the industry.

                    <b>BAT threatens to leave Chile:</b> In 2015, BAT threatened to stop operations in Chile
                    when the
                    national legislature was considering a bill designed to strengthen tobacco-control measures,
                    including plain packaging. <sup>1</sup> Movement on the bill stalled, but the company
                    closed several
                    factories anyway. However, BAT Chile maintains critical manufacturing facilities in the
                    country. It exports cigarettes to seventeen countries around the world. <sup>2</sup> The
                    decision to
                    close some factories in Chile can be interpreted as a decision to consolidate based on cost
                    efficiency and not on local tobacco-control laws.

                    <b>In Canadain 1994–95:</b>During the campaign for plain packaging, the specter of job
                    losses in
                    the tobacco growing, manufacturing, and packaging sectors was often raised by opponents.
                    Representatives of both Ontario and Quebec growers stated that plain packaging would
                    intensify price competition, causing tobacco firms to move their manufacturing facilities
                    outside Canada. Plain packaging was dropped at that time, but most of the jobs in the
                    tobacco industry were lost anyway. Imperial Tobacco moved all production to Mexico,
                    tobacco-crop production has dropped 87% and tobacco packaging firms have downsized in
                    Canada. <sup>3</sup>

                <p>
                    <b>In the UK:</b> A report commissioned by Philip Morris claimed that plain packaging would
                    lead to
                    between 2,000 and 3,500 jobs lost in the convenience retailing sector, thanks purely to the
                    decrease in revenue through tobacco sales. It claimed a further 2,250 to 3,850 jobs were
                    expected to be lost in the tobacco manufacturing sector, despite a rise in tobacco
                    consumption. <sup>4</sup>

                    generates £12.1 billion in revenue each year for the Government.” [p. 3]

                    industry's tactics against plain packaging in Australia, and outlined how “The industry
                    hides behind a libertarian cloak, complaining that Australia is an over-regulated ‘nanny
                    state’ that will suffer job losses and further hardship if more regulation such as plain
                    packaging is required by law.” <sup>5</sup> However, even when BAT announced the closure
                    of its
                    manufacturing facility in Australia in 2015, it specifically stated that plain packaging was
                    <i>not the reason for the closure.</i> <sup>6</sup>

                        The tobacco industry constitutes a very small fraction of overall production and

                        depend on tobacco has been falling in most countries, owing to such things as
                        technological innovation and globalization. For most countries, tobacco-control measures
                        will have only a modest impact on employment and will not lead to net job losses.

                        instance, a drop from 20% to 18% in the overall smoking rate) would be followed by an
                        expected $63 billion reduction in healthcare expenditure <u>the next year</u>.

                        manufacturing facilities where costs are lowest. Thus, decisions are based on global
                        economic factors and not by strong local tobacco-control policies. For example, when
                        Japan Tobacco International closed its last production facility in the United Kingdom,
                        it also closed facilities in Belgium and Germany and moved production to Poland and
                        Romania. JTI said the restructuring would allow the company to optimize its
