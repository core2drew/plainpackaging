                    1.1 Constitutional challenge in the High Court of Australia — dismissed in August 2012
                </h3>
                <p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2012/43.html">JTInternational SA v.
                        Commonwealth of Australia [2012] HCA 43 (5 October, 2012)</a></p>
                <p>The four major tobacco companies challenged the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 based on
                    section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, which deals with the acquisition of property by
                    the state. </p>
                <p>The two principle arguments were that plain-packaging laws were a breach of the
                    constitution because they amounted to an acquisition of the tobacco companies’
                    intellectual property rights including trademarks‘and that the government’s use of or
                    control over the packaging itself amounted to an acquisition of property.</p>
                <p>The High Court ruled in the Government’s favor by 6 to 1.</p>
                <p>One judge observed that the tobacco companies’ most strenuous objection was the taking
                    <i>“of the advertising or promotional functions of their registered trademarks.”</i></p>
                <p>The High Court held that, to be an acquisition, the Government must obtain a benefit or
                    interest of a “proprietary nature.” One judge stated that <i>“on no view can it be said
                        that the Commonwealth. . . has acquired any benefit of a proprietary character”</i>;
                    and another that the requirements of the Act <i>“are no different in kind from any
                        legislation that requires labels that warn against the use or misuse of a
                        product.”</i>Moreover,that <i>“[m]any kinds of products have been subjected to
                        regulation in order to prevent or reduce the likelihood of harm, including
                        medicines, poisonous substances and foods.”</i></p>
                <p>The transcripts of the hearings<sup>1</sup> show that counsel for Japan Tobacco
                    International (JTI) and Imperial Tobacco compare the cigarette packet to advertising
                    billboards by saying that Australia <i>“is acquiring our billboard, your Honour”</i>;
                    and <i>“I own this packet and I will determine what message goes on it”</i>. . . it is
                    our <i>“bonsai billboard.”</i></p>

                        href="https://pcacases.com/web/view/5">Case 2012–02</a></p>
                <p>Philip Morris Asia brought a claim under a bilateral investment treaty between Australia
                    and Hong Kong to obtain compensation for losses it claimed were due to the
                    plain-packaging laws. The two main arguments of Philip Morris were: that plain packaging
                    had the equivalent effect of “expropriating” the property rights in its trademarks that
                    could no longer be used on packaging; and that the measure was “arbitrary” and
                    “unreasonable” on the basis that there was no evidence it would work. </p>
                <p>However, in order to bring the claim, Philip Morris International restructured, so that
                    ownership of 100% of its shares in Philip Morris Australia were transferred from PMI
                    (based in Switzerland) to Philip Morris Asia (based in Hong Kong) <i>after</i> the
                    Australian government had announced its intention to adopt plain packaging of tobacco
                    products. The arbitration tribunal found that this was done for the sole purpose of
                    bringing a claim under the investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia and the
                    claim was therefore <i>“an abuse of rights.”</i> The tribunal therefore declined
                    jurisdiction, and the merits of the claim were not considered. </p>

                </p>
                <p>The dispute arose out of complaints by Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia,
                    and Ukraine that the plain-packaging laws breach various articles of the WTO agreements,
                    and a dispute settlement panel was composed in May 2014. The final oral hearing took
                    place in October 2015, and final summary written submissions were made in December 2015.
                    The On May 28, 2015, Ukraine suspended their dispute in order to negotiate a mutually
                    agreed solution with Australia. The panel has stated that its ruling will be given not
                    before May 2017. It is possible for parties to appeal to the WTO's Appellate Body.</p>
                <p>The complaining countries argue that Australia’s law breaches:</p>
                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS
                        Agreement) by failing to provide required protections to trademarks rights and
                        because it is an unjustifiable encumbrance on the use of tobacco trademarks;
                    </li>
                    <li>the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) because it is more
                        trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective; and
                    </li>
                    <li>the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) because it provides imported
                        tobacco products less favorable treatment than like products of national origin.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ruling is highly anticipated and has significant wider relevance that is clear from
                    the fact that there are more third-party WTO member states that have made written and
                    oral submissions to the panel than for any previous WTO dispute — some 34 countries plus
                    the EU. It has been reported that Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are
                    providing legal and financial support to the Dominican Republic and Honduras. </p>

                        EWHC 1169 (Admin); [2016] EWCA Civ 1182 (Appeal)</a><sup>3</sup></p>
                <p>Claims were commenced by the four big international tobacco companies — British American
                    Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco International — together
                    with a German manufacturer of cigarette tipping paper (TANN). The 17 grounds of claim
                    were under domestic administrative law, European Union Law, and the European Convention
                    of Human Rights. </p>
                <p>This is an important judgment that has wider international significance. The ruling dealt
                    with the merits of most of the key legal issues set out above in section 2. The judge
                    gave particular attention to issues of international relevance including —the importance
                    of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); the public health
                    justification for plain-packaging laws; the issue of whether or not there is a right to
                    use trademarks; and a detailed analysis of the evidence that supported the policy and
                    the tobacco companies’ evidence submitted to oppose the policy. </p>
                <p><b class="fc-ref-mat-4">The judge’s analysis of the evidence from both sides of the
                        dispute</b> is particularly significant because the same evidence should be
                    considered by any government taking forward plain packaging. This is the first judgment
                    that provides a careful scrutiny of that evidence, confirming that it meets relevant
                    legal tests.</p>
                <p>On the tobacco industry’s evidence, the judge said that, <i>“On the basis of my own
                        review of the methodologies adopted by the Claimants’ experts . . . I conclude that
                        that body of expert evidence does not accord with internationally recognised best
                        practice.”</i> And was heavily critical of <i>“what has the appearance of being an
                        industry wide practice not to adduce internal documents or to allow their experts to
                        see and review and then rely upon internal documents.”</i></p>

                    of Justice— dismissed in May 2016</h3>
                <p><i><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-547/14">R (Philip Morris Brands
                            Sarl & Others) v. Secretary of State for Health C–547</a></i></p>
                <p>The aim of the EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) is to provide a harmonized regulatory
                    environment for tobacco products across the EU (including on emissions, health warnings,
                    labeling, and reporting requirements) to assist the free movement of those goods. In
                    doing so, the Directive takes a high standard of public health. Some provisions of the
                    TPD introduce elements of a plain-packaging policy, such as the requirement for cuboid
                    cigarette packs with flip top lids, and a minimum of 20 cigarettes per pack. The TPD
                    also includes, inArticle 24(2), a provision that member states may adopt further
                    measures in relation to the standardization of tobacco packaging. </p>
                <p>The four major international tobacco companies commenced a legal claim in the UK courts,
                    challenging the government’s intention to implement the TPD on the basis that the
                    Directive was not validly made. The High Court referred questions of interpretation of
                    EU law to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The legal challenge sought
                    to overturn the whole Directive on a number of different grounds and also challenged the
                    validity of separate parts of the TPD, including Article 24(2).</p>
                <p>All grounds of challenge were dismissed and the validity of the Directive upheld. The
                    importance of the FCTC was highlighted by the CJEU, which emphasized that its guidelines
                    could have “decisive influence” on the interpretation of EU laws on tobacco control. But
                    the key aspect of the judgment relevant to plain packaging, is that the Court of Justice
                    confirmed that the Tobacco Products Directive permits EU Member States to introduce
                    measures to standardize the packaging of tobacco products. </p>
                <p>The opinion of the Advocate General (adopted by the Court) confirmed that measures to
                    standardize packs contribute to increasing the visibility of health warnings and that
                    these measures are proportionate because purely economic interests in the functioning of
                    the tobacco market are secondary to the protection of human health.</p>

                    were just one part). The plain-packaging measures were challenged on the basis of the
                    legislative process, the constitutional rights to property and free enterprise, and on
                    the proportionality of the measures.</p>
                <p>The Constitutional Council noted that the brand name can still be applied to packages

                    held that there was no expropriation of property but a limitation on the property rights
                    justified by the objective of protecting public health, because the plain-packaging
                    measure made it possible to prevent the pack from becoming a piece of advertising. The
                    Court noted the measure does not prohibit the production, distribution, or otherwise the
                    sale of tobacco products. Accordingly, the measure was held to be a proportionate
                    infringement of the rights of commerce and free enterprise. </p>

                <p>The detailed Decree and Ministerial Order to implement plain packaging were published on
                    March 22, 2016, and came into force May 20, 2016.</p>
                <p>JTI launched an action on April 29, 2016, at the level of the Conseil d’État (the highest
                    administrative court) alleging that the laws are in breach of the French constitution.
                    Similar actions were launched by Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, and British American
                    Tobacco; by the Confédération Nationale des Buralistes de France (the National
                    Organization for Tobacco Retailers in France); and by République Technologie (a
                    cigarette-paper manufacturer) in May 2016.</p>
                <p>The petitioners contended that the measures constituted an infringement of fundamental
                    rights relating to property; that they disregarded the principle of free enterprise;
                    that they infringed the constitutional principle of clarity and intelligibility of the
                    law; that they violated the provisions of trademark rights and intellectual property;
                    that they constitute an assault on France’s international commitments under the European
                    Convention of Human Rights, on the free circulation of products within the European
                    Union, on the Convention of Paris, and the WTO agreement on issues of trade-related
                    aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS).</p>

                    November 2016</h3>
                <p><b><i>JTI v. Minister for Health, Ireland, and the Attorney General 2015/2530P</i></b>
                </p>
                <p>Legislation for plain packaging on all tobacco products was adopted on March 10, 2015,
                    and was due to come into force on May 20, 2016.However, some amendments were required to
                    the law, and the likely coming into force date is now in 2017. JTI issued legal
                    proceedings in 2015 challenging the Irish legislation. Following an initial hearing, JTI
                    confirmed that its claim was based solely on the ground that the law is incompatible
                    with the EU Tobacco Production Directive (TPD). The proceedings were stayed pending the
                    outcome of the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling on the tobacco companies’
                    challenge to the TPD (see above 3.1). In addition, JTI explicitly stated that it
                    reserves its position in relation to all other potential grounds pending the outcome of
                    the UK High Court ruling (see above 2.1). Once the EU and UK cases were dismissed, JTI’s
                    claim was then struck out. Ireland has a constitution that protects property rights with
                    no limitation period; therefore, a constitutional challenge may be brought at some stage
                    whatever the outcomes of the other cases, and it is understood that JTI formally
                    reserved its position on this issue.</p>

                    in July 2016</h3>
                <p><b><i>Morris Brand Sàrl (Switzerland) & Others v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay</i></b> <a
                        href="https://www.italaw.com/cases/460">(ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7)</a></p>
                <p>This case was not a challenge to plain packaging but rather two other packaging laws
                    introduced in Uruguay in 2008 and 2009, stipulating:</p>
                <ul class="no-list-style">
                    <li>1. that large graphic health warnings should cover 80% of the front and back of
                        cigarette packets.
                    </li>
                    <li>2. that each cigarette brand be limited to just a single variant or brand type
                        (eliminating brand families to address evidence that some variants can mislead
                        consumers and falsely imply some cigarettes are less harmful than others) — known as
                        the Single Presentation Requirement (SPR).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, the arguments put forward by Philip Morris in this investment arbitration claim
                    are very similar to those used in the investment arbitration case against Australia’s
                    plain packaging. Consequently, the ruling is highly relevant to the legality of plain
                    packaging under international investment law. The Australian claim was dismissed on
                    jurisdiction grounds, whereas the tribunal in this case determined the merits of the
                    legal arguments and dismissed all grounds ofclaim.PMI alleged that the two measures
                    violated a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with Switzerland<sup>5</sup> and brought
                    the claim after legal challenges in Uruguay’s domestic courts by the Philip Morris
                    subsidiaries had failed. It sought an order for the repeal of the Challenged Measures
                    and for compensation in the region of $25 million. </p>
                <p>The landmark ruling highlighted the importance of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco
                    Control (FCTC) in setting tobacco-control objectives and establishing the evidence base
                    for measures. The ruling confirmed that states need not recreate local evidence to
                    justify tobacco-control measures. It addressed the wide “margin of appreciation” and
                    deference provided to sovereign states in adopting measures or decisions concerning
                    public health. </p>
                <p>The ruling sets an extremely high bar for any foreign investor seeking to bring an
                    investment arbitration challenge against a non-discriminatory public health measure that
                    has a legitimate objective and that has been taken in good faith.</p>
                <p>The arbitrator appointed by PMI, Gary Born, agreed with the ruling on most aspects but
                    gave a <b>dissenting opinion</b> on two issues. One of these was that the SPR had been
                    adopted in an arbitrary manner and therefore breached the obligation of <i>fair and
                        equitable treatment</i>. Part of his reasoning was that there was, in his view, no
                    record of any proper consideration of the evidence and issues by Uruguay before adopting
                    the measure (See <a
