                <p>These pages summarise the empirical research evidence that supports the implementation of
                    plain packaging. </p>
                <p>Over the course of 20-30 years there have been many <b>peer reviewed scientific research
                        studies</b> looking at the
                    impact
                    that plain packaging of tobacco would have on smoking behaviours and attitudes and the
                    likely consequential impact
                    on smoking rates.</p>
                <p>Research has been conducted in more than 10 different countries using a range of
                    methodologies and each study taken
                    in isolation only provides part of the picture. </p>

                <p><u>The different types of research studies include</u>:</p>
                <p>Behavioural studies aimed to test whether participants believed that plain packaging
                    would change their purchasing
                    behaviour. </p>
                <p>Surveys of consumer groups to consider the appeal of plain packs compared with branded
                    packs.</p>
                <p>Studies using mock-ups of standardised packaging to see how smokers and potential smokers
                    react to them.</p>
                <p>Eye tracking studies that looked at whether people focused more on the health warnings
                    when branding was
                    removed. </p>
                <p>Qualitative and survey research looking at the impact of removing branding on smoker
                    image and product
                    associations. </p>
                <p>Studies into whether and how perceptions of the harmfulness and strength of standardised
                    packages differ from
                    branded packs (and how different kinds of plain packages differ in this regard). </p>
                <p>Studies using a “pack-offer” task to assess the demand for plain packaging. In each of
                    these studies, youth
                    participants were offered a choice of packs.</p>
                <p>Naturalistic trials of plain packaging where smokers used brown ‘plain’ packs for two
                    weeks and their regular packs
                    for two weeks in “real-life” settings. The studies analysed avoidance behaviours, such
                    as hiding or covering the
                    pack.</p>

                <p>This research is criticised by the tobacco industry because the studies consider
                    attitudes, beliefs, and predictions
                    of future behaviour but fail, they claim, to demonstrate a link with actual behaviour.
                    They also criticise the
                    methodology of individual studies. But the research is persuasive because of the high
                    degree of consistency across
                    more than 75 studies from numerous countries and using different methodologies. </p>
                <p>The tobacco industry also criticises the research for failing to include a randomised
                    control trial of plain
                    packaging. But as has been pointed out, it would not be possible or ethical to undertake
                    such a trial. To do so
                    would require studies to be carried out within a suitably large and isolated population
                    free of known confounding
                    factors that influence smoking and prevalence. Such studies would expose a randomised
                    group of children and/ or
                    adults to nicotine exposure and addiction. </p>
                <p>As is highlighted elsewhere in this toolkit, <b>the tobacco industry is rarely, if ever,
                        able to rely on peer
                        reviewed
                        studies to support its arguments that plain packaging will not be effective; and the
                        tobacco companies have
                        consistently refused to disclose any of their own research or behavioural studies
                        into the likely effects of
                        plain
                        packaging</b>.</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Attractiveness of tobacco products and packaging as
                    advertising</h3>
                <p><b>A substantial number of studies that examine plain packaging support the conclusions
                        that the measure reduces the
                        attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products.</b></p>
                <p>This includes experimental studies from Australia, <sup>1</sup> Brazil, <sup>2</sup>
                    Canada, <sup>3</sup> New
                    Zealand, <sup>4</sup> and the
                    USA <sup>5</sup>; survey
                    evidence
                    from
                    Australia <sup>6</sup>, France <sup>7</sup>, the UK <sup>8</sup>, and the USA
                    <sup>9</sup>; and focus group
                    studies from New
                    Zealand <sup>10</sup> and
                    the United
                    Kingdom <sup>11</sup>.
                    Evidence
                    also shows that the advertising function of tobacco packaging has also been specifically
                    targeted at youth by the
                    tobacco companies. <sup>12</sup></p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">The effectiveness of health warnings</h3>
                <p><b>Studies show that colorful and attractive branding on packaging detracts and distracts
                        from health warnings,
                        thereby reducing their effectiveness.</b></p>
                <p>A number of studies suggest that plain packaging increases the salience of health
                    warnings, including experimental
                    and survey studies from Australia and Canada <sup>13</sup>, with impacts that go above
                    and beyond simply
                    introducing larger
                    health
                    warnings without plain packaging <sup>14</sup>. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Misleading tobacco packaging</h3>
                <p><b>Studies have demonstrated there is a strong association between pack design and false
                        consumer perceptions of
                        risk. <sup>15</sup> </b></p>
                <p>Tobacco branding can mislead consumers as to the relative harms of one product compared
                    to other products. Many
                    countries have banned terms such as “light” and “mild” for this reason, as all the
                    evidence shows that these
                    products are equally dangerous. However, smokers and non-smokers continue to hold
                    mistaken beliefs about different
                    tobacco products because of the tobacco companies’ use of colors and branding. Some pack
                    designs preserve the
                    branding used for prohibited brand variants. For instance, Marlboro Lights became
                    Marlboro Gold, and Marlboro Ultra
                    Lights became Marlboro Silver. Similar tactics were used by other companies. The color
                    of packs in particular
                    affects consumers’ perceptions of risk. Lighter packs are perceived as being less harsh
                    and having lower tar levels
                    than darker colors, even when there is identical products in them. <sup>16</sup></p>

                <p>Peer-reviewed studies from many countries show that plain packaging will minimize the
                    ability of packaging and brand
                    variants to mislead consumers about the relative harms of different products.

                </div>
                <p>Australia, the UK, and Ireland, when considering plain packaging, commissioned
                    independent reviews of the research
                    evidence to ensure that there is a clear, complete, and balanced picture. More recently,

                        href="http://www.cochrane.org/about-us">Cochrane</a>, a global
                    independent non-profit organization, undertook a review of the research studies that
                    evaluated plain or standardised
                    packaging.</p>

                <p>The four reviews show that the evidence on plain packaging is notable for its breadth and
                    diversity of methods but
                    also for the strong consistency of the results in supporting that plain packaging will
                    contribute to its objectives.

                <p>By the time of the Hammond Review commissioned by the Irish Government in 2014, a total
                    of 69 original empirical
                    studies were reviewed. Research continues to be undertaken throughout the world and
                    there have also been many
                    post-implementation studies conducted in Australia (see the <b>Australia’s Post-

                <p>This was the first evidence review that provided the support for Australia to move ahead
                    with the policy. The more
                    recent reviews looked at the studies considered in this paper as well as subsequent

                <div id="item4"  class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-3">2. The Stirling Review</div>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Background</h3>
                <p>In 2012,the UK Department of Health commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on
                    plain tobacco packaging. The
                    review was supported through the Public Health Research Consortium (PHRC), a network of
                    researchers at the
                    University of Stirling, the University of Nottingham, and the Institute of Education,
                    London.</p>

                <p>Screening led to 37 studies being analyzed. The resulting report was peer reviewed and
                    published at the same time as
                    the 2012 consultation. It was made clear that the PHRC report represented the work and
                    views of the authors, not
                    necessarily those of the UK Department of Health. An update was published in September
                    2013, which considered
                    seventeen new studies published since the original Stirling Review in 2012.</p>

                <a href="http://phrc.lshtm.ac.uk/project_2011-2016_006.html">http://phrc.lshtm.ac.uk/project_2011-2016_006.html</a>(Original)

                (Update)

                <p>The Stirling Review found that:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“There is strong evidence to support the propositions. . . that plain
                    packaging would reduce the
                    attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products, it would increase the noticeability and
                    effectiveness of health
                    warnings and messages and it would reduce the use of design techniques that may mislead
                    consumers about the
                    harmfulness of tobacco products.”</p>
                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Methodology</h3>

                <p>The review aimed to examine all available current evidence on the effects of plain
                    packaging in the areas of pack
                    appeal; effectiveness of health warnings; and perceptions of product harm and strength.
                    It employed systematic
                    review methodology and examined studies from 1980 to the date of review.</p>

                <p>A total of 4,518 citations were identified following initial searching, and, after
                    screening and quality appraisal,
                    37 studies were included in the systematic review. Most of the studies included in the
                    review were conducted in
                    Australasia, North America, or Western Europe.</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Findings</h3>

                <p>Appeal of cigarettes, packs and brands: </p>
                <p>All studies reported that plain packs were rated as less attractive than branded
                    equivalent packs by both adults
                    and children. </p>
                <p>Plain packs were perceived to be poorer quality, poorer tasting, and cheaper than branded
                    equivalent packs.</p>
                <p>Positive impressions of smoker identity and personality attributes associated with
                    specific brands were weakened or
                    disappeared with plain packaging.</p>
                <p>Non-smokers and younger people responded more negatively to plain packs than smokers and
                    older people. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Effectiveness of health warnings</h3>
                <p>Overall, the studies suggest that plain packaging tends to increase the recall of health
                    warnings, the attention
                    paid to them, and their perceived seriousness and believability. </p>
                <p>Findings appear to be moderated by the type, size, and position of health warning
                    used.</p>
                <p>Only one study examined sub-group differences and reported that non-smokers and weekly
                    smokers may pay more
                    attention to warnings on plain packs than daily smokers. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Perceptions of product harm and strength:</h3>
                <p>Plain packaging can reduce misperceptions about the relative harmfulness of different
                    brands.</p>
                <p>Colors of packs affect perceptions of product harm and strength. In general, plain packs
                    are perceived as more
                    harmful than branded packs if in a darker color, such as brown, and, conversely, less
                    harmful than branded packs if
                    in lighter colors, such as white. Red packs are perceived to contain stronger cigarettes
                    than light-colored
                    packs.</p>
                <p>Use of descriptors, such as “gold” or “smooth,” on plain packs have the potential to
                    mislead consumers, as they do
                    on branded packs.</p>
                <p>In general, smokers are more likely to have misperceptions about the harmfulness of
                    packs, both branded and plain,
                    than non-smokers. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Smoking-related attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and
                    behavior:</h3>
                <p>Plain packs appear to increase negative feelings about smoking. </p>
                <p>Plain packs are generally perceived as likely to have a deterrent effect on the onset of
                    smoking by young people
                    and as likely to encourage existing smokers to reduce their consumption or to quit,
                    although in some studies they
                    are perceived as likely to have little impact. </p>
                <p>Non-smokers, lighter smokers, and younger people are more likely to perceive that plain
                    packs would discourage or
                    reduce smoking. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Plain packaging has been shown to:</p>
                <p>reduce pack and product appeal by making packs appear less attractive and of lower
                    quality, and by weakening the
                    positive smoker identity and personality attributes associated with branded packs;</p>
                <p>increase the salience of health warnings in terms of improving the recall and perceived
                    seriousness and
                    believability of warnings; and</p>
                <p>reduce the confusion about product harm that can result from branded packs. </p>

                <p>Plain packaging was also perceived as likely to have a deterrent effect on the onset of
                    smoking by young people and
                    as likely to encourage existing smokers to quit. The review also found some evidence
                    that non-smokers and, to a
                    lesser extent, smokers approved of the idea of plain packaging, with both groups feeling
                    it would make smoking less
                    attractive, particularly to young people.</p>

                <p>Despite some limitations of the review identified by the researchers, they say that it is
                    worth emphasizing the
                    remarkable consistency in study findings regarding the potential impact of plain
                    packaging. Across studies using
                    different designs, conducted in a range of countries, with young and older populations
                    and with smokers and
                    non-smokers the key findings are similar. This consistency of evidence can provide
                    confidence about the observed
                    potential effects of plain packaging.</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Background</h3>
                <p>In November 2013, the UK Department of Health commissioned Sir Cyril Chantler to
                    undertake an independent review of
                    whether or not the introduction of standardized packaging of tobacco was likely to have
                    an effect on public health,
                    in particular in relation to children.</p>
                <p>The remit of this review was wider than the Stirling Review and included consideration of
                    evidence on the impact in
                    Australia as well as industry arguments and possible unintended consequences.</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Methodology</h3>
                <p>The Chantler Review considered all the evidence relevant to whether or not the
                    introduction of standardized packaging
                    would be beneficial to public health. The validity of the Stirling systematic review was
                    also considered. </p>
                <p>The Chantler Review invited interested parties to submit research-based material, and
                    took evidence during two
                    meetings. Separate meetings were held withthe Smokefree Action Coalition, the Tobacco
                    Manufacturers Association,and
                    representatives of Philip Morris Ltd. Sir Cyril also visited Australia to study its
                    experience of implementing plain
                    packaging.</p>
                <p>He commissioned further expert advice to assist in the analysis of the key evidence. In
                    particular, two specific
                    pieces of independent analysis on the qualitative and quantitative studies in the
                    Stirling Review (and the
                    subsequent update) using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme assessment tools. These
                    were undertaken by academics at
                    Southampton University and Kings College London, respectively.</p>
                <p>The report of the Chantler Review was published in April 2014 and is available here: <a

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Findings</h3>

                <p>Sir Cyril Chantler’s overall conclusion was that it is “<b>highly likely that
                        standardised packaging would serve to
                        reduce the rate of children taking up smoking and implausible that it would increase
                        the consumption of tobacco
                        . . . I am satisfied that the body of evidence shows that standardised packaging, in
                        conjunction with the
                        current tobacco control regime, is very likely to lead to a modest but important
                        reduction over time on the
                        uptake and prevalence of smoking and thus have a positive impact on public
                        health</b>.”</p>

                <p>Tobacco marketing and branding</p>

                <p class="p-states">“<b>There is very strong evidence that exposure to tobacco advertising
                        and promotion increases the
                        likelihood of children taking up smoking. Industry documents show that tobacco
                        packaging has for decades been
                        designed, in the light of market research, with regard to what appeals to target
                        groups</b>. Branded cigarettes
                    are
                    ‘badge’ products, frequently on display, which therefore act as a “silent salesman.”
                    Tobacco packages appear to be
                    especially important as a means of communicating brand imagery in countries like
                    Australia and the UK which have
                    comprehensive bans on advertising and promotion. . .</p>

                <p class="p-states">The tobacco industry argues that all of its marketing activity,
                    including packaging, aims solely to
                    persuade existing adult smokers to switch brand and never targets children or new
                    smokers. However, in my opinion,
                    whatever their intent, it is not plausible that the effect of branded packaging is only
                    to encourage brand switching
                    amongst adult smokers, and never to encourage non-smokers from taking up smoking. I have
                    heard no coherent argument
                    as to how this purported separation occurs in practice and in my opinion a ‘spillover
                    effect’ is highly plausible
                    whereby packages that are designed to appeal to a young adult, also, albeit
                    inadvertently, appeal to children. <b>It
                        seems to me that children and non-smokers are not, and cannot be, quarantined from
                        seeing tobacco packaging and
                        in
                        my view once they are exposed to this packaging, they are susceptible to its appeal
                        whether it is intended to
                        target
                        them or not. In the light of these and other considerations set out in my report I
                        believe that branded
                        packaging
                        contributes to increased tobacco consumption</b>.”</p>

                <p>The evidence</p>
                <p class="p-states">“There has been, as opponents of standardised packaging have rightly
                    pointed out to me in the course
                    of this Review, no randomised controlled trial carried out to test the impact of
                    standardised packaging on the take
                    up of smoking amongst children.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I do not consider it to be possible or ethical to undertake such a trial. To do so would
                    require studies to be
                    carried out within a suitably large and isolated population free of known confounding
                    factors that influence smoking
                    and prevalence. Such studies would expose a randomised group of children to nicotine
                    exposure and possible
                    addiction.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>I see the importance of Stirling as being the consistency of its results on appeal,
                        salience and perceptions of
                        harm, most notably that standardised packaging is less appealing than branded
                        packaging</b>. This evidence is
                    direct and
                    not reliant on stated intentions. Evidence from other spheres shows a strong
                    non-conscious link between appeal and
                    subsequent behaviour regardless of stated intentions. I therefore conclude that, by
                    reducing its appeal,
                    standardised packaging would affect smoking behaviour.”
                </p>

                <p>Industry arguments</p>
                <p><i>Plain packaging will lead to price reductions:</i></p>

                <p class="p-states">“First, tobacco companies have argued that standardised packaging will
                    result in falling prices that
                    in turn will increase the consumption of tobacco. They argue that, in the long-run at
                    least, standardised packaging
                    will reduce brand loyalty, causing smokers to switch to cheaper brands and encouraging
                    price competition between
                    manufacturers. However, <b>early evidence from Australia does not show falling prices;
                        rather price rises have
                        continued over and above tax increases</b>. There is some evidence of trading down
                    towards cheaper brands, but
                    this
                    appears to be a continuation of an ongoing market trend. Were all this to change, the
                    Government can in any case
                    mitigate any price reduction by increasing tobacco taxes.”</p>

                <p><i>Plain packaging will lead to price reductions:</i></p>

                <p class="p-states">“Second, I am not convinced by the tobacco industry’s argument that
                    standardised packaging would
                    increase the illicit market, especially in counterfeit cigarettes. There is <b>no
                        evidence that standardised
                        packaging
                        is easier to counterfeit, and indeed in Australia, hardly any counterfeit
                        standardised packages have been found
                        to
                        date</b>. The tobacco industry has a history of attacking new tobacco control
                    measures on the basis that they
                    will boost
                    illicit sales, arguing that illicit suppliers benefit from not having to follow the same
                    restrictions.” </p>

                    the industry’s extensive use of packaging as a marketing tool. This part of his report

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Findings</h3>

                <p>Professor Hammond summarizes the academic literature with respect to six primary
                    outcomes: health warnings,
                    perceptions of risk, consumer appeal, measures of consumer demand and smoking behavior,
                    post-implementation research
                    from Australia, and research on differences in plain packaging colors. The findings
                    are:</p>

                <p>Health warnings</p>
                <p class="p-states">“Overall, the evidence suggests that health warnings are more noticeable
                    on plain packs, associated
                    with greater recall of health messages, and may lead to greater cognitive processing,
                    particularly among youth
                    non-smokers. The evidence also indicates that the effect of package branding persists
                    even in the context of large
                    pictorial warnings, and that plain packaging and health warnings have complimentary, but
                    independent effects on
                    consumer perceptions.”</p>

                <p>Perceptions of risk</p>
                <p class="p-states">“Many consumers continue to hold false beliefs that some cigarette
                    brands are less harmful than
                    others, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Pack design and colour promote
                    false beliefs about the relative
                    risks between brands. A variety of experimental studies indicate that plain packaging is
                    associated with fewer false
                    health beliefs.”</p>

                <p>Consumer appeal</p>
                <p class="p-states">“The evidence unequivocally demonstrates that plain packaging is
                    perceived as less attractive and
                    less appealing, particularly among youth and young adults, including smokers and
                    non-smokers. Plain packaging is
                    also associated with less positive brand imagery, including smoker traits, such as cool,
                    stylish, thin. The findings
                    suggest that plain packaging is less socially desirable and limits the ability of
                    packaging to target sub-groups of
                    youth and young adults.”</p>

                <p>Measures of consumer demand and smoking behavior</p>
                <p class="p-states">“Evidence from a range of methodologies indicates that plain packaging
                    reduces consumer demand.
                    Evidence from a limited number of naturalistic studies suggest that plain packaging may
                    promote smoking cessation
                    among established smokers, although additional studies are required to demonstrate this
                    effect. Findings from
                    clinical studies also indicates that branded tobacco packaging is a reliable cue for
                    smoking and can prompt urges to
                    smoke among former smokers, and that exposure to plain packages reduces urges and
                    motivation to smoke compared to
                    branded packages.”</p>

                <p>Post-implementation: the impact of plain packaging regulations in Australia</p>
                <p class="p-states">“Given the novelty of plain packaging regulations in Australia, there
                    are few studies to assess the
                    impact of plain packaging. To date, three published studies provide preliminary evidence
                    suggesting that plain
                    packaging has had a positive public health impact in Australia. Of the three studies,
                    objective data indicating a
                    significant increase in calls to the Quitline — an effective form of smoking
                    cessation149 — are most compelling. No
                    studies have examined the impact of plain packaging within the context of smoking
                    initiation.”</p>

                <p>Plain pack color</p>
                <p class="p-states">“Studies are consistent in demonstrating that darker, non-white colours
                    are perceived as
                    significantly less appealing and more effective. Therefore, while the primary objective
                    of standardizing colour
                    would be to have uniform appearance, to minimize the belief that some products are less
                    harmful than others, using a
                    darker colour may reduce the overall appeal of all packages.”</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Conclusions</h3>
                <p>The report draws some strong conclusions, which are in line with the conclusions of the
                    Chantler Review:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“Tobacco advertising and marketing are among the most important factors
                    in the rise of smoking in
                    the 20th century. Industry marketing campaigns have sought to communicate three
                    fundamental themes: 1) product
                    satisfaction; 2) reassurance about the health concerns; and 3) positive associations
                    between smoking and desirable
                    outcomes, such as independence, social status, sexual attraction and thinness. Tobacco
                    industry documents and
                    independent evidence indicates that packaging has played a fundamental role in executing
                    each of these themes, and
                    has grown in importance as other forms of advertising and marketing have been
                    prohibited.

                    <br>

                    “The scientific evidence on plain packaging includes more than 70 original empirical
                    articles from a wide variety of
                    research domains. Most of the research on plain packaging is experimental in nature and
                    has been conducted in
                    jurisdictions without plain packaging given that plain packaging regulations were only
                    implemented in December 2012
                    in Australia. The evidence is highly consistent across different research domain and
                    study designs, as well as
                    between experimental and more recent “post-implementation” studies conducted in
                    Australia.
                </p>

                <p>“Overall, the existing evidence on plain packaging supports four primary conclusions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Plain packaging will reduce smoking initiation among youth and young adults.</li>
                    <li>Plain packaging will promote smoking cessation among established smokers.</li>
                    <li>Plain packaging will support former smokers to remain abstinent.</li>
                    <li>Plain packaging will help to denormalize tobacco use”</li>

                        a review in April
                        2017</a> which looked at the peer-reviewed published evidence assessing the effect
                    of plain packaging on tobacco use, uptake, cessation, and reduction.</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Methodology</h3>
                <p>The review searched nine databases for articles evaluating standardised packaging that
                    had been already reviewed by
                    academics and published before January 2016. We also checked references in those papers
                    to other studies and
                    contacted the authors where necessary. The research found 51 studies involving
                    approximately 800,000
                    participants.</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Primary Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The primary outcome measured by the review was changes in tobacco use prevalence
                    including uptake, cessation and
                    reduction in overall consumption. </p>
                <p>The review found only 5 studies that addressed these primary outcomes measurements. The
                    reason for this may be that
                    even in Australia, it is at an early stage of implementation to get reliable statistical
                    data on the impacts of
                    plain packaging on overall prevalence. </p>
                <p>The only study that considered overall prevalence was the analysis by Professor Chipty
                    that is included in
                    Australia’s Post Implementation Review (see the pages on <b>Australia Post
                        Implementation Evidence</b> in the Tools
                    and
                    Resources). That analysis of statistical data concluded that a drop of 0.55 percentage
                    points in smoking prevalence
                    was attributable to plain packaging. </p>
                <p>3 studies on consumption in Australia and the UK found little change in smokers’
                    consumption levels.</p>
                <p>A national study of adult smoker quit attempts showed an increase from 20% prior to the
                    introduction of plain
                    packaging, compared to 26.6% 1 year after implementation. This was backed up by the fact
                    that calls to quit lines
                    increased by 78%. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Secondary Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The review anticipated very few studies on the primary outcome at this stage of
                    implementation. The review therefore
                    also reviewed studies on secondary outcomes including:</p>
                <p>behaviours such as stubbing out cigarettes early, covering the pack, and eye tracking in
                    experimental studies,
                    and</p>
                <p>non-behavioural studies such as intentions of young people, pack appeal, recall of health
                    warnings and perceptions
                    of harm.</p>

                <p>These studies found evidence of increased avoidance behaviours, increased attention to
                    health warnings and reduced
                    cravings. Studies also indicated that plain packs were less likely to motivate
                    initiation among youth.</p>

                <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The review concluded that the evidence suggests that standardised packaging may reduce
                    smoking prevalence. The review
                    noted the limitations on the currently available data on prevalence but concludes that a
                    reduction in smoking
                    behavior is supported by routinely collected data by the Australian government. Data on
                    the effects of standardized
                    packaging on non-behavioral outcomes (e.g. pack appeal and recall of health warnings)
                    are clearer and provide
                    plausible mechanisms for the observed decline in prevalence.</p>

                <p>The review did not find any evidence suggesting standardized packaging may increase
                    tobacco use. <sup>19</sup></p>

                <div id="item8" class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-3">Further research evidence</div>

                <p>Further research into likely impacts of tobacco plain packaging has continued to be
                    undertaken around the world since
                    these evidence reviews were published. The following is not intended to be a
                    comprehensive review of this additional
                    evidence but provides examples and information about the continued research into the
                    likely impacts of plain
                    packaging of tobacco products. </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A systematic review of existing literature was undertaken in 2016 to consider the
                        impact of plain packaging in
                        low- and middle-income countries and in low-income settings in high-income
                        countries. It concluded that plain
                        packaging had less appeal than branded packaging in low- income settings.
                        <sup>20</sup>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 2015 study undertook experimental research into the effects of plain packaging and
                        graphic health warnings
                        on adolescents in Spain, France, and the USA, and concluded that both policies
                        impacted on cravings and evoked
                        fear and thoughts of quitting. <sup>21</sup>
                    </li>
                    <li>A study in France considered young roll-your-own smokers’ response to using plain
                        packaging in real-world
                        settings and found them to be associated with less-positive product perceptions,
                        negative feelings about
                        smoking, and increased reported feelings about reducing consumption and quit

                    </li>
                    <li>Two experiments in the UK found that branded packs primed a greater percentage of
                        tobacco seeking behavior in
                        current smokers. <sup>23</sup>
                    </li>
                    <li>A study in Thailand used a variety of methods withstudents to look at the impact of
                        plain packaging on health
                        warning salience on cigarette packs. <sup>24</sup>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 2016 study led to results demonstrating that plain packaging and health warnings
                        work independently and in
                        unison to influence smokers’ and non-smokers’ behavioral intentions. <sup>25</sup>
                    </li>
                    <li>A 2016 study considered the impact of cigarette packaging design, such as “slims”
                        branding and warning
                        labels, on perceptions of taste harm and interest among young females in Canada. The
                        study concludes that plain
                        packaging may decrease demand and reduce misleading perceptions in young females.
