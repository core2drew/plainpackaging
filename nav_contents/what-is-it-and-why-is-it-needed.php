            <p>
                Plain packaging of tobacco is a common sense policy that removes the promotional, marketing
                and advertising features on packs of tobacco, but leaves the health warnings, tax stamps and
                other features required by government. Most governments have increased the size of the
                health warnings at the same time as introducing plain packaging. The main elements of a
                plain packaging of tobacco policy are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Packaging must be a <b>uniform plain unattractive color</b> usually a dull brown/green;
                </li>
                <li>All packs must be a <b>standard shape, size and texture</b>, and be made from cardboard;
                </li>
                <li><b>No branding, logos or other promotional elements</b> can appear on the packaging - or
                    on individual cigarette sticks;
                </li>
                <li>The brand and product name can appear on each pack, as well as the quantity of product
                    in the pack and manufacturer’s contact details, but in a standard size, color and
                    typeface.
                </li>
                <li>Health warnings, tax stamps and other government requirements remain on the packs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Packaging for all products can act as a form of promotion, marketing and advertising. This
                is even truer for tobacco because in countries where other advertising is restricted, the
                pack becomes the main means of promoting tobacco; and tobacco is a ‘badge product’ which
                people carry around with them and display every time they take the pack out.<sup>1</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Brightly coloured and attractive branding distracts attention from the health warnings</p>
            <p>Even where misleading descriptors such as ‘light’ and ‘mild’ have been banned, branded
                packaging continues to create
                strong but false perceptions that some variants are less harmful than others. These ‘health
                reassurance’ brands use
                light and bright colors to mislead consumers and help to maintain addiction. </p>

                as a marketing tool by the tobacco industry.</p>

                “Our final communication vehicle with our smoker is the pack itself. In the absence of any
                other marketing messages, our packaging...is the sole communicator of our brand essence. Put
                another way—when you don’t have anything else—our packaging is our marketing.” BAT

                In the legal claim in the Australian High Court, counsel for Japan Tobacco International
                argued that tobacco packaging acted like an advertising billboard.

            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-4">Plain or Standardised?</div>
            <p>
                The most commonly used term for the policy is ‘<b>plain packaging</b>’ – this is the term
                used by
                Australia and the WHO. But because packs retain the health warnings they are not literally
                ‘plain’, and the industry has tried to spread confusion about this. In the UK and Ireland
                the term used is ‘<b>standardised packaging</b>’. In France the term used is ‘<b>neutral
                    packaging</b>’
                and elsewhere governments have called it ‘<b>generic packaging</b>’. These are all different
                terms
                for the same policy.
            </p>

            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-4">How will plain packaging work?</div>
            <p>
                Plain packaging helps to change smoking attitudes and behaviours and reduce the overall
                demand for tobacco. It is likely to have a greater impact on younger people. Plain
                packaging:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Reduces the appeal and attractiveness</b> of tobacco products to consumers,</li>
                <li><b>Increases the noticeability and effectiveness of health warnings</b> on the packaging
                    of
                    tobacco products,
                </li>
                <li><b>Reduces the ability of the packaging of tobacco products to mislead</b> consumers
                    about
                    the harmful effects of smoking or using tobacco products.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                See <b>Guide 1.1 Set the objectives</b> for more details.
            </p>

            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-4">Does it work – what does the evidence say?
            </div>
            <p>Yes. There have been five international systematic evidence reviews that considered all the
                peer reviewed research studies from around the globe on the impact of plain packaging on
                smoking behaviours and attitudes. <sup>2</sup> All concluded that the policy would be
                effective at
                contributing to its objectives.</p>

            <p>In Australia, over 4 years of post-implementation data shows continued significant declines
                in smoking rates. <sup>3</sup> The government’s post implementation review concluded that
                a 0.55
                percentage point drop could be attributed to plain packaging <b>(equivalent to 118,000 less
                    people smoking <sup>4</sup> over 3 years)</b>,</p>

            <p>The tobacco industry has refused to release any of its own internal research into the impacts
                of plain packaging. The studies the tobacco companies rely on to oppose plain packaging are
                almost universally not peer reviewed; are unverifiable; and either ignore or airily dismiss
                the global evidence that supports the policy being effective. <sup>5</sup></p>

                Australia’s post implementation evidence in the Tools and Resources for fully referenced
                information on all the supporting evidence.</p>
