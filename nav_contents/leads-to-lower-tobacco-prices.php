                    The tobacco companies argue that plain packaging will commoditize tobacco, meaning that the
                    only way to compete is on price which will lead to price reductions which in turn will then
                    lead to increased demand.

                    Lower Tobacco Prices

                <p>
                    A number of the “unintended consequences” suggested by the tobacco industry center on the
                    assertion that standardized packaging would cause tobacco product prices to drop, especially
                    in the premium segment of the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tobacco companies have, for many years, invested in building premium brands, for which
                    consumers are willing to pay more. The tobacco industry say that, with plain packaging,
                    smokers would no longer be willing to make purchasing decisions based on a brand identity,
                    with premium brands having the greatest to lose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tobacco companies claim that, where branding cannot be used, this will lead to increased
                    price competition instead (sometimes referred to as “commoditization”), which will lead to
                    lower-priced tobacco products. Lower-cost tobacco leads to increased demand. The tobacco
                    companies use this argument to suggest that plain packaging will actually increase smoking
                    rates (or reduce the rate of decline).

                    In a plain packaging environment, it will become ever more difficult to sell products in
                    the
                    premium segments. When all packs look virtually identical and physically feel exactly
                    the

                    smokers will be more unwilling to pay a higher price for our premium products. [para

                    Downtrading
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, each of the tobacco companies has said that they believe that there would, in
                    time, be increased “<b>downtrading</b>” (or brand switching), whereby smokers choose to
                    purchase
                    lower priced brands instead of more expensive premium brands as a result of plain packaging.
                    If there is less perceived ‘”status’” to be gained from identifying as a consumer of a
                    high-end brand, which may be the case if tobacco packs were standardized, some say that
                    smokers will switch to cheaper alternatives and price would become the key way to
                    differentiate between products.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This, they claim, would mean that overall, the price of purchased tobacco would be lower and
                    that downtrading stimulates demand.

                    segments of the legal market, with the greatest price falls in the premium sector, where
                    branding is a key element of differentiation; lower prices would lead to increased tobacco
                    consumption . . .”

                <p>
                    In the tobacco companies’ legal challenge to the UK plain packaging regulations, the
                    companies submitted expert evidence, <sup>1</sup> which they claimed demonstrated that
                    plain
                    packaging
                    would increase smoking rates (or would reduce the existing downward trend of those rates).
                    That expert evidence included lengthy and complex economic analysis. Fundamental to these
                    economic models was the assumption that plain packaging will significantly increase
                    downtrading.

                    <b>Two issues at the <i>core</i> of the tobacco industry’s legal case that plain packaging
                        is a

                        downtrading.</b>
                    The judge in the UK case rejected these arguments, stating not only had the government
                    proved its case but also that the evidence submitted by the tobacco companies had
                    fundamental methodological flaws. <sup>2</sup>
