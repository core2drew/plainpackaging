                    and now rigorously assessed. Further, it is set within the context of wider Australian

                    action has to be strategic and comprehensive. There are no silver bullets”
                    <sup>1</sup></p>

                <p>The information contained in this Reference Section gives just some examples of the
                    observational, research and
                    survey studies that have been conducted in Australia to assess the impact of plain
                    packaging there, together with
                    the statistical data on tobacco use.</p>

                <p><b>A more comprehensive compilation of the evidence</b> can be found on Cancer Council
                    Victoria’s “Plain Facts”
                    website:
                    <a href="http://www.cancervic.org.au/plainfacts/">http://www.cancervic.org.au/plainfacts/</a>
                    which includes some
                    detailed fact sheets. </p>

                <p>The research demonstrates that the policy is starting to have the anticipated impacts on
                    the intended mechanisms of
                    reducing tobacco appeal, increasing the effectiveness of health warnings and reducing
                    misperceptions about the harms
                    of tobacco products. It should nevertheless be recognized that it is a policy intended
                    to have impacts over time. It
                    was introduced at the same time as a number of other tobacco control measures and
                    isolating the specific influence
                    of plain packaging will also take time.</p>

                <p>The tobacco industry has sought to highlight isolated anomalies in the statistical data
                    to argue that plain packaging
                    has not worked or is having a negative impact. These examples, set out below, have no
                    statistical significance and
                    should not detract from the vast majority of the evidence that all points to the policy
                    working as intended. The
                    tobacco industry has also commissioned reports that try to analyse the statistical data
                    to show that plain packaging
                    has <i>not increased the existing rate of decline</i> in smoking rates. These reports
                    have not been peer reviewed,
                    have
                    been
                    undermined by academics and criticized by Courts. (For more details on those reports see

                <p>The British Medical Journal of Tobacco Control <a
                        href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/24/Suppl_2?utm_source=World%20Congress%20on%20Tobacco%20and%20Health&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=plain%20packaging">edition
                        of April 2015</a> focused on the implementation and evaluation of
                    the Australian plain packaging policy and included eighteen research papers.</p>

                <p>Further peer-reviewed research studies have been published since then. Combined these
                    studies show:</p>

                <p><b>Reduced appeal of tobacco</b>:A number of studies with adult smokers point to plain
                    packaging fulfilling its core
                    aims of
                    reducing appeal, particularly among young adults, and increasing warning salience. <sup>2</sup>
                </p>

                <p>These research papers also suggest that plain packaging is severely restricting the
                    ability of the pack to
                    communicate and create appeal with adolescents and young people. For instance,
                    school-based surveys with students
                    aged 12–17 years old in 2011 and 2013 show that the removal of branding and uniformity
                    of pack appearance has
                    increased negative pack ratings and decreased positive ones. <sup>3</sup></p>

                <p><b>Increased quit attempts</b>: In a cross-sectional tracking survey of cigarette
                    smokers, plain packaging was
                    associated
                    with increased thinking about quitting and quit attempts. In addition, dislike of the
                    pack, lower satisfaction from
                    cigarettes and attributing motivation to quit to the warnings predicted daily thoughts
                    of quitting. <sup>4</sup>
                </p>

                <p>Research has also found a significant increase in the number of calls to the smoking
                    cessation helpline, Quitline, in
                    NSW and the ACT. <sup>5</sup> The research showed a 78% increase in the number of calls
                    to the Quitline
                    associated with the
                    introduction of plain packaging. This research found the increase in calls was sustained
                    and not attributable to
                    anti-tobacco advertising activity, cigarette price increases, or any other identifiable
                    causes.</p>

                <p><b>Increased impact of health warnings</b>: A number of studies using large national
                    survey samples have found that
                    more
                    adult smokers noticed graphic health warnings and this led to increased pack avoidance,
                    greater perceived harm, and
                    an increased understanding of cancer risks. <sup>6</sup></p>

                <p>
                    <b>Reduced pack displays</b>: Studies of outdoor venues before and after implementation
                    have showed that smokers
                    were more likely to conceal their packs in outdoor venues after the introduction of
                    plain packaging. <sup>7</sup>
                </p>

                <p><b>Reduced misperceptions</b>: A recent study showed that following plain-packaging
                    implementation, there was a
                    significant reduction in perceptions that “some cigarette brands are more harmful than
                    others.” <sup>8</sup></p>

                <p><b>Increase in positive attitudes to plain packs</b>: A recent study showed that the
                    positive response of young
                    people to plain packaging was greater than anticipated prior to its introduction, and
                    support for plain packaging
                    increased from pre-implementation to post-implementation among all
                    groups of youth. <sup>9</sup></p>

                <p><b>Unintended consequences.</b> The research has also examined whether or not plain
                    packaging had any of the
                    unintended
                    consequences that the tobacco industry alleged would occur:</p>

                <p><b>Tobacco prices continue to rise in all sectors</b>: Studies showed that there was no
                    evidence that plain packaging
                    led
                    to lower prices for tobacco. A review of retail magazines, for instance, showed that
                    following the introduction of
                    plain packaging, average inflation-adjusted recommended retail prices actually increased
                    for cigarettes in all price
                    segments (value, mainstream, and premium). <sup>10</sup></p>

                <p><b>No increase in illicit tobacco</b>: The evidence clearly showed that the consumption
                    of illicit “cheap white”
                    cigarettes has remained consistently small or even declined after implementation of
                    plain packaging. <sup>11</sup>
                    And the
                    total
                    amount of tobacco intercepted by Border Service in 2014–15 was considerably lower than
                    in recent years.
                    <sup>12</sup></p>

                <p>The tobacco companies have argued that use of illicit tobacco increased <sup>13</sup> by
                    relying on a report they
                    commissioned
                    from
                    KPMG. <sup>14</sup> However, those reports have been heavily criticized, and KPMG has
                    stated that its report<i>“has
                        been
                        somewhat
                        misrepresented by others, without our consent, to suggest it supports the contention
                        that plain paper packaging
                        could lead of itself to an increase in tobacco smuggling.” <sup>15</sup></i>Litter
                    surveys have found no
                    evidence of any counterfeit plain packs to date. </p>

                <p><b>No increase in retail transaction time</b>: Again, in contrast to the claims made by
                    the tobacco companies that
                    plain
                    packs would increase the time that retailers took to find packs, real-life observational
                    studies have showed that
                    average transactions times declined for plain packs after implementation <sup>16</sup>
                    possibly because packs were
                    now stored
                    alphabetically. </p>

                <p>The Australian government published its Post-Implementation Review (PIR) in February
                    2016:</p>

                <a href="https://ris.govspace.gov.au/2016/02/26/tobacco-plain-packaging/">https://ris.govspace.gov.au/2016/02/26/tobacco-plain-packaging/</a>

                <p>The review concludes that <b><i>“the measure has begun to achieve its public health
                            objectives of reducing smoking
                            and
                            exposure to tobacco smoke in Australia and it is expected to continue to do so
                            into the future.”</i></b></p>

                <p>In line with Australian government guidance, the PIR examines the post-implementation
                    evidence, data, and analysis of
                    the broader costs and benefits to industry, government and the wider community, to
                    evaluate the efficiency and
                    effectiveness of the tobacco plain packaging measure. Much of this evidence and data is
                    described in the first two
                    parts of this Section. The PIR provides the Australian Government’s analysis of that
                    evidence.</p>

                <p><b>The summary of the PIR states that:</b></p>

                <p class="p-states"><b>“While the full effect of the tobacco plain packaging measure is
                        expected to be realised over
                        time,
                        the evidence examined in this PIR suggests that the measure is achieving its aims.
                        This evidence shows that
                        tobacco
                        plain packaging is having a positive impact on its specific mechanisms as envisaged
                        in the TPP Act. All of the
                        major
                        data sets examined also showed on-going drops in national smoking prevalence in
                        Australia.</b> These decreases
                    cannot be
                    entirely attributed to plain packaging given the range of tobacco control measures in
                    place in Australia, including
                    media campaigns and Australia’s tobacco excise regime.”</p>

                <p>
                    The PIR provides an analysis of peer-reviewed research studies into smoking attitudes
                    and behaviors before and after
                    the introduction of the policy. These show that it is having a positive impact on the
                    three specific mechanisms of
                    reducing the appeal of tobacco products, increasing the effectiveness of health
                    warnings, and reducing the ability
                    of the pack to mislead:
                </p>

                <p class="p-states">
                    “Taken as a whole, the studies . . . provide early evidence that the tobacco plain
                    packaging measure is having a
                    positive impact on the three specific mechanisms of reducing the appeal of tobacco
                    products, reducing the potential
                    for tobacco packaging to mislead consumers, and enhancing the effectiveness of graphic
                    health warnings. Studies also
                    provide early evidence that the measure is resulting in positive changes to smoking
                    behaviours. The body of evidence
                    is diverse, including analyses conducted on a range of different groups (including
                    adolescents, adults, cigarette
                    smokers and cigar/cigarillo smokers) and using different datasets (including the
                    National Tracking Survey, the NSW
                    Tracking Survey, the ASSAD data, the ITC Project data and bespoke surveys).”
                </p>

                <p>The report also reviews the available data and statistical analysis of smoking prevalence
                    and tobacco consumption
                    rates: </p>

                <p class="p-states">“All the major data sets show continuing declines in smoking prevalence
                    with substantial declines in
                    the period following the introduction of tobacco plain packaging. Analysis of the Roy
                    Morgan Research data
                    undertaken for the Department (described below) concludes that the 2012 packaging
                    changes have already contributed
                    to the overall decline in smoking prevalence and that over time these impacts will
                    increase.”</p>

                <p>The use of statistical data can be complex, and the tobacco industry has produced reports
                    that seek to undermine the
                    argument that large reductions in the smoking rates can be attributable to plain
                    packaging of reduced smoking. Thus,
                    for instance, the JTI response to the PIR has been to say that,“The report fails to
                    properly take into account that
                    smoking rates had been steadily declining for years, long before the introduction of
                    this branding ban, and that the
                    measure hasn’t accelerated this decline.” <sup>25</sup></p>

                <p>Most of the evidence and studies that the PIR refers to and considers was already
                    publicly available. However, the
                    PIR was accompanied by a new detailed data analysis by Dr.TasneemChipty of Analysis
                    Group, Inc., who undertook a
                    regression analysis. This used Roy Morgan Single Source Survey Data to provide an
                    average prevalence rate for the 34
                    months prior to implementation of plain packaging and the 34 months following
                    implementation. Those figures were
                    19.4% and 17.2%, respectively — a 2.2% percentage point drop. </p>

                <p>Dr Chipty’s analysis estimated that the packaging changes resulted in a <b>“statistically
                        significant decline in
                        smoking
                        prevalence of 0.55 percentage points over the post implementation period, relative
                        to what the prevalence would
                        have
                        been without the packaging changes. This decline accounts for approximately one
                        quarter of the total decline in
                        average prevalence rates observed . . .”</b></p>

                <p>Trying to use statistical analysis of survey data to separate out the effects of
                    different tobacco-control measures
                    is difficult, but it is this detailed report by Dr.Chipty that undermines the tobacco
                    industry claims of no
                    accelerated decline. </p>

                <p>Dr.Chipty’s analysis was set out in figurative form in the following chart:</p>

                <img class="img-responsive center-block" width="450px"
                     src="<?php echo $base_url; ?>img/evidence/australia-2.jpg">

                <p>This chart plots the monthly overall smoking prevalence rates from the Roy Morgan data,
                    with two separate trend lines
                    for before and after the introduction of the 2012 packaging changes. The chart shows the
                    overall decline in smoking
                    prevalence in Australia over the last fifteen years and provides some indication that
                    the “decline in prevalence has
                    accelerated in recent years.” As regards the effects on the illicit market, the PIR
                    considers the post-
                    implementation data and peer-reviewed studies that found no change in smokers’ reported
                    use of unbranded illicit
                    tobacco, no evidence of increases in use of contraband cigarettes, low levels of use of
                    cigarettes likely to be
                    contraband, and no increase in purchases of tobacco from informal sellers.</p>

                <p>The PIR concludes that:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“the measure has begun to achieve its public health objectives of
                    reducing smoking and exposure to
                    tobacco smoke in Australia and it is expected to continue to do so into the future</p>
