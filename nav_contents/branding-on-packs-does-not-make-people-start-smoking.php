                <p>
                    The tobacco companies seek to blur the overwhelming view of marketing theory and evidence
                    that advertising affects overall consumption of a product. This despite all the internal
                    tobacco industry documents to the contrary (see theTobacco Branding pageof the Tools and
                    Resources).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tobacco companies argue that branding only promotes brand switching by current smokers and
                    has no effect on overall primary demand. They say that even a small amount of brand
                    switching is worth a lot of money to them. However, cigarette brands enjoy the highest brand
                    loyalty of all consumer products, with fewer than 10 percent changing brands annually. Brand
                    choices are usually made early in the life of a smoker, with a high concordance between
                    brand first smoked and the brand eventually selected as a usual brand. Thus, once a smoker
                    embraces a cigarette brand, it is quite unlikely that they will change.

                    the use of trade marks to identify and distinguish products.
                    <br/>

                    its marketing activity, including packaging, aims solely to persuade existing adult smokers
                    to switch brands rather than to persuade people (including in particular children) to take
                    up smoking.” <sup>5</sup>

                    In their submission to the Norway consultation, JTI also sought to argue that tobacco
                    packaging does not influence smoking behavior. The company argued that packaging and
                    advertising are not the same and should not be conflated. It claims that fundamental
                    marketing theory shows that in a “mature market,” such as in Norway (where growth has slowed
                    and awareness of the product is universal), marketing is not to persuade non-users to try
                    the product but to persuade existing users to swap brands. They argue that branding promotes
                    brands not the act of smoking. <sup>6</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tobacco companies have been making this argument about the role of advertising in mature
                    markets for nearly three decades to seek to prevent any restrictions on tobacco advertising.
                    It is noted in the US Surgeon General’s report that, at a congressional hearing in 1989, an
                    industry spokesperson claimed that the function of advertising in a mature market “is to
                    promote brand loyalty or brand switching.” <sup>7</sup> Even then it was highlighted
                    that textbooks
                    state
                    that when faced with a so-called mature market, advertising firms can and often should
                    attempt to both increase usage among existing customers and to address potential new
                    users. <sup>8</sup>
                    The surgeon general also pointed out that the strongest indicator that tobacco companies
                    must seek out large numbers of new users stems from the feature of the tobacco market that
                    millions of its customers die every year and millions more quit. The only way to maintain
                    the mature market is to recruit new users.

                        each time the product is used and are often left in public view between uses.
