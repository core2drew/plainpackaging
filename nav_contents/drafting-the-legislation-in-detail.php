                <p><b>The guiding principle behind plain packaging</b> is that the only means of differentiating
                    products should be through the brand and variant name, which are presented in a standard

                    drawn from the existing legislation in those countries that have already enacted plain
                    packaging laws. Other governments considering plain packaging will need to review the nature
                    of the products and packaging that exist in their market and adjust, or amend, their
                    legislation accordingly. </p>

                    The European Union Tobacco Products Directive (EU TPD) includes some provisions concerning
                    the packaging and presentation of tobacco products and so requires a ‘partial’
                    standardisation of packaging policy (for instance, the shape and opening of cigarette
                    packets as well as the minimum content). These obligations must be implemented by all EU
                    Member States, including the UK, Ireland, France and Hungary. Where a reference is made to
                    one of these EU TPD requirements, it will necessarily be part of the domestic legislation in
                    each of those countries.

                <div class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-2">1. Color</div>
                <p>It is important to specify very precisely the <i>exact</i> color required for the packaging,
                    otherwise variations of color will appear, defeating the intention of standardizing
                    packaging. Simply requiring brown, or a green/brown, is insufficient.</p>
                <p>Pantone provides a system of accurate color categorisation. There are no copyright issues in
                    using these colors in legislation (this was confirmed with Pantone in the UK and Australia).
                    The Pantone system has terms of categorisation and identification and the colors are not
                    trademarked.</p>
                <p>What color should the packs be? Australia commissioned research into which color was
                    perceived to be the least appealing for tobacco packaging. The research looked at a range of
                    issues, including consumer perceptions of branding appeal and smoking harm, consumer
                    perceptions of plain pack colors, and legibility of brand names on plain packs. The research
                    found a dark brown color to be the best candidate, as people perceived it to be the least
                    appealing and thought that the packs would contain cigarettes that are more harmful to
                    health and harder to quit.</p>

                <p>Unless there is specific evidence or research that demonstrates different colors would be
                    more effective in a particular country at achieving the aims of the policy, it is
                    recommended that these colors are used in all plain packaging legislation because of the
                    research already conducted that demonstrates the efficacy of this colour. There could be
                    legal risks in deviating from that evidence base.</p>
                <p>A ‘matt finish’ to the surface should also be specified to avoid some packs appearing with a
                    glossy or other finish.</p>
                <p>The color of the inside or internal surfaces of packs also need to be defined. In most

                <p>It is sensible to include a provision in the legislation which states that the plain

                    symbol as these can provide positive social associations for tobacco manufacturers. </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>iii. Where there are requirements for different surfaces (for instance the brand name
                        must appear only on the front and top surfaces), then consideration needs to be given as

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The existing legislation of countries that have adopted plain packaging approach these issues
                    in different ways. An example is given in the Model Law included with this Toolkit.</p>

            <div class="content-desc-cont col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
                <div class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-2">5. Shape and type of packets</div>
                <p>When standardising the shape and type of packaging it is recommended that the legislation
                    requires the most common type of packaging that already existing on the market. The most
                    common type of cigarette pack around the world is a rectangular (or cuboid) box of 20
                    cigarettes with a flip top lid.</p>
                <p>However, governments considering plain packaging should look at what packaging already exists
                    and is common on the market in their country. Some pack shapes may have positive
                    associations for consumers, such as with the slim packs discussed above, so there may be
                    good reasons to prohibit them. However, without good reason, prohibiting the most commonly
                    used type of packaging for a particular category of product could be grounds for legal
                    challenge as being unnecessarily restrictive or leading to unnecessary costs for the tobacco
                    manufacturers by forcing a change to their manufacturing processes. This is one reason why
                    it is recommended that MoH officials conduct a market survey of the packaging that exists on
                    the market in their country (see <b>Guide 2.1: Evidence Review</b>).</p>

                <div class="section-tertiary-title fc-ref-mat-2"><u>Cigarettes:</u></div>
                <p>In Australia, packs must conform to <b>specific dimensions</b> with <b>rectangular surfaces
                        that have straight sides and right angles<sup>2</sup></b>, and so pack shape is defined
                    in that way. This means that all individual packs must be virtually identical in shape and
                    size. Beveled edges are prohibited. This legislation therefore requires what is, for many
                    countries, the most common shape, size and opening of cigarette packs.</p>
                <p>For EU states, under the EU TPD, packs must be <b>cuboid<sup>3</sup></b> but there is no
                    specified dimension (although the full health warning must be fitted on the appropriate
                    surfaces which means that ‘slim packs’ are not allowed – see part 7 below). This means there
                    is some scope for tobacco companies to vary the dimensions of the cuboid shape and soft
                    packs are permitted.</p>
                <p>Just requiring a cuboid like the EU is a simpler means of specifying the shape but specifying
                    dimensions and prohibiting bevelled or rounded edges as Australia has done is
                    recommended.</p>
                <p>Shoulder box packs and soft packs are permitted for cigarettes in EU countries but not in
                    Australia.</p>

                <p>In Australia there are no specific requirements on the shape, size or type of containers for
                    other tobacco products.</p>
                <p>For EU states, under the EU TPD, hand rolled or roll-your-own tobacco must be in a <b>cuboid
                        pack, a cylindrical pack</b> or be in the <b>form of a pouch</b>. No further

                <p>As with the shape of packs, it is recommended that governments considering plain packaging

                <p>In Australia, cigarette packs must have a “flip-top lid,”hinged at the back. No other opening
                    is allowed.</p>
                <p>In the EU,cigarettes in a pack that can be resealed or reclosed must have either flip-top lid
                    hinged at the back, or a shoulder box hinged lid — “clam shell” — hinged at the back
                    <sup>5</sup>. This also permits soft packs that involve tearing open the paper seal and
                    cannot be reclosed once opened. All these packs are common in some EU countries.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Unless soft packs or the clam shell / shoulder-box lid is particularly common in the market
                    of a country considering plain packaging, it is recommended that the approach of Australia
                    is followed, so that cigarettes are only permitted in hard packets with a flip top lid.</p>
                <p>However, no legislation currently defines flip-top lid. It is a term commonly understood to
                    mean the most usual type of cigarette pack opening.</p>
                <p>There was some correspondence between the UK government and Imperial Tobacco about whether or
                    not a novel type of opening for Lambert and Butler, called “Glide Tec” (which involves
                    sliding a panel on the front of the pack with your thumb to make the very top of the pack
                    flip open) can fall within the definition of a flip-top lid. As the diagram below shows, the
                    Glide Tec opening is at the top and it flips open. Without a specific definition in
                    legislation it is arguable that different types of opening such as Glide Tec could fall
                    within the term. Drafters should therefore consider whether to either define flip-top lid
                    (which can be difficult) or use a diagram within the legislation, such as the one shown
                    above and included in the <b>TEMPLATE MODEL LAW.</b></p>

                <p>These slim packs usually have slim cigarettes contained in them.</p>
                <p>Australia sets minimum and maximum dimensions for individual packets and also has minimum and
                    maximum dimensions for the cigarette stick.</p>
                <p>Under the EU Tobacco Products Directive, the graphic health warnings on cigarette packs must
                    conform to minimum dimensions as well as being 65% of the front and back surfaces, which
                    means that small cigarette packets are not permitted because they could not fit the
                    full-size health warnings on them. Because of this, EU countries have so far not set minimum
                    dimensions for pack sizes.</p>
                <p>A decision to fully future proof the policy would mean following the Australian example, as
                    this better protects against variations in the sizes of cigarette packs. This is the
                    approach taken in the Template Model Law.</p>

                <p>While using a novel or different material to make packaging might be expensive for
                    manufacturers, it is not inconceivable that this would be used to differentiate a particular
                    product. It is therefore important to specify what material must be used to make the
                    cigarette packs.</p>
                <p>There is already some variation in the packaging material used for other types of product,
                    such as loose tobacco or cigars. For instance, loose tobacco can comes in tins, pouches, or
                    boxes. Thus far, states adopting plain packaging have not put as many restrictions on the
                    nature of the packaging for other tobacco products, but each government considering the
                    policy should review the products on the market in that country and consider if it is
                    appropriate to specify the material (as well as shape and size) of packs for products other
                    than cigarettes.</p>
                <p>Australia requires that cigarette packs must be rigid and made of only cardboard<sup>8</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>The EU TPD requires cigarette packs to be made of “carton or <i>soft</i>
                    material,”<sup>9</sup> which does provide for some scope for variation. Only time will show
                    ifany significant variations in packaging material are developed in EU countries that adopt
                    plain packaging. </p>
                <p>It is recommended that countries follow the approach of Australia unless there are local

                <p>The packaging processes for cigarettes use linings to fit the cigarettes into the packets.
                    These linings are typically made of a silver foil with a white paper backing. The foil has
                    small embossed marks on them that are necessary to provide the friction used to insert the
                    cigarettes into the packets. For this reason, these linings are permitted in the legislation
                    of those states that have adopted plain packaging, so long as they are only for the <i>“automated
                        manufacturing process”</i> and only if the linings conform to the specified requirements<sup>10</sup>
                    and do not have any branding on them.</p>
                <p>It is recommended that similar provisions are used in any plain packaging law to avoid
                    tobacco manufacturers arguing that the laws required unnecessary and expensive changes to
                    their packaging processes.</p>

                <p>It is important to specify that the lining is “only for the purpose of the automated
                    manufacturing process.” In Australia, some products have been manufactured where the
                    “lining” can act as a separate container so that the cigarettes can be removed from the
                    standardized pack:</p>

                    text of the <b>Template Model Law</b> is used because that draft text requires that all
                    packaging must be rigid cardboard or, if it is the lining, a single sheet of paper backed
                    silver foil.

                    wrappers have promotions or price discounts printed on them.</p>
                <p>Wrappers should be required to be entirely clear and transparent, otherwise there is the risk
                    of a loophole in the legislation that could allow the branding to appear on the wrappers (or
                    without specific drafting in the law, the wrapperscould fall within the definition of <i>external
                        packaging</i> and so required to be Pantone 448c, which would be an excessive policy
                    prescription).</p>
                <p>All existing plain packaging legislation includes this requirement<sup>12</sup>.</p>
                <p>A tear strip is used to open the wrappers, and these should also be regulated. In most
                    existing legislation, they must either be clear or black and should be no more than 3mm
                    wide.</p>
                <p>Some manufacturers use the wrapper to print the bar code on, and there is no reason to
                    prohibit this. Therefore a single bar code should be permitted on the wrapper, so long as it
                    does not cover the front surface of the packet or cover any health warning or other mandated

                    around the circumference of a cigar, which complies with the color scheme and text
                    requirements of the plain packaging legislation.</p>

                <p>Manufacturers and retailers will have existing stock that does not comply with new packaging
                    laws. Sufficient notice of when the law will come into force ensures that producers and
                    retailers have sufficient time to sell existing stock before changing packaging to comply
                    with the new law. This weakens any industry argument that it has suffered loss as a
                    consequence of holding unsold stock. Australia allowed a three-month sell-through period for
                    plain packaging, after which old packs could no longer be sold; the UK allowed a full year.
                    The question of what is a sufficient period of time may differ from country to country.
                    Officials should consider what periods have been allowed for previous packaging
                    requirements, such as changes to health warnings.</p>

                <p>There are important legal reasons to ensure that tobacco companies can maintain their
                    trademark registrations even if the use of those trademarks is severely restricted by plain
                    packaging. There are international, regional, and national laws that oblige states to
                    maintain trademark registrations. Therefore, most plain packaging legislation (for instance
                    in Australia, the UK, and Ireland<sup>24</sup>) has a trademark-registration-saving
                    provision that states that the legislation does not amount to a prohibition on the use of
                    the trademarks in all circumstances, and that non-use of a trademark as a result of the
                    legislation amounts to a good reason for non-use.</p>

                <p>There are of course issues that need to be tailored to the particular country’s laws and
                    thatare common to all tobacco-control measures but, as ever, care has to be taken in getting
                    these right. In particular offenses, compliance, and enforcement provisions need to be dealt
                    with. Countries with existing packaging and labeling legislation will already have
                    experience with what offenses and enforcement provisions are effective:</p>
                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>
                        <b>The offences provisions and application to corporations / Directors</b>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Guidelines for Implementation of Article 11 of the WHO FCTC include general
                            provisions relating to liability and enforcement. For example, on the question of
                            who is legally responsible for compliance with packaging and labeling measures, the
                            Guidelines at paragraph 55 state: <i> “Parties should specify that tobacco product
                                manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retail establishments that sell
                                tobacco products bear legal responsibility for compliance with packaging and
                                labelling measures.”</i></p>
                        <p>With respect to penalties, the Guidelines state: <i>“In order to deter non-compliance
                                with the law, Parties should specify a range of fines or other penalties
                                commensurate with the severity of the violation and whether it is a repeat
                                violation.”</i> Moreover, <i>“Parties should consider introducing any other
                                penalty consistent with a Party’s legal system and culture that may include the
                                creation and enforcement of offences and the suspension, limitation or
                                cancellation of business and import licences.”</i></p>
                        <p>In the UK, for instance, a person who manufactures or imports a tobacco product that
                            is intended for sale in the UK, or sells a tobacco product in the UK (either in
                            trade or to a consumer) that has retail packaging that does not comply with the
                            Regulations is liable for a range of criminal penalties from a fine of up to £5000
                            to a jail sentence of up to two years. The UK law also stipulates that, if an
                            offense is committed by a body corporate (a corporation or company), then the
                            officers of the company, such as the managing director, may be
                            prosecuted.<sup>25</sup> The prospect of a jail sentence for the company management
                            means that compliance with tobacco-control laws in the UK is generally high.</p>
                        <p>The Australian Government introduced civil and criminal penalty provisions relating
                            to noncompliant tobacco packaging and non-compliant tobacco products. These include
                            fault-based offenses and strict liability offenses (where there is no need to show
                            fault). Penalties for non-compliance can be imposed on retailers, manufacturers,
                            suppliers or all of them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Powers of search, seizure and provision of information. </b>
                        <br>
                        <p>Effective enforcement is important for compliance with all tobacco-control measures.
                            The FCTC Guidelines for Article 11 recommend, <i>“Parties should consider granting
                                enforcement authorities the power to order violators to recall noncompliant
                                tobacco products, and to recover all expenses stemming from the recall, as well
                                as the power to impose whatever sanctions are deemed appropriate, including
                                seizure and destruction of non-compliant products. Further, Parties should
                                consider making public the names of violators and the nature of their
                                offence.”</i></p>
                        <p>Making public the names of violators can be an effective measure....</p>
