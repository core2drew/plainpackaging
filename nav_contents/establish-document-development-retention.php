                    courts and international tribunals, can often include a claim that due process has not
                    been adhered to or that effective consideration of all the relevant evidence and issues
                    was not had before a final decision was made. It is important that a government can
                    demonstrate the steps it has taken.</p>
                <p><span class="fc-violet"><b>IN THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ARBITRATION</b></span> claim
                    brought by Philip Morris International against two of Uruguay’s tobacco control laws2,
                    the arbitrator appointed by Philip Morris, Gary Born, gave a dissenting opinion on
                    certain issues where he disagreed with the outcome of the tribunal award (<i>see</i>
                    <span class="fc-violet"><b>Guide 4.2</b></span>). Gary Born’s dissenting opinion was
                    that Uruguay’s Single Presentation Requirement (that only permits each brand to have a
                    single variant) was adopted without due process or proper consideration of the evidence
                    and was therefore arbitrary and in breach of Uruguay’s Bilateral Investment Treaty with
                    Switzerland:</p>
                <p class="p-blockquote">“In my view, <b>the record does not support</b> a conclusion that
                    the single presentation requirement … was preceded by any meaningful internal study,
                    discussions or deliberations at the Ministry of Public Health, or by other Uruguayan
                    authorities…</p>
                <p class="p-blockquote">It is significant that the evidentiary record contains no minutes,
                    agendas, protocols, preparatory materials, memoranda, letters, emails or other
                    documentary evidence suggesting that any meetings, conference calls or other
                    interactions concerning the single presentation requirement ever occurred.” [108 – 109]
                    (emphasis added)</p>
                <p>The position of the Uruguayan Government was that the policy was properly considered
                    before being adopted and the majority of the tribunal agreed, but the fact that one of
                    the three arbitrators was prepared to find a breach of the Investment Treaty that could
                    have led to huge damages being awarded is a reminder to Governments of the need to
                    follow due process and <b>keep a record of that process.</b></p>

                <p>In addition, governments need to be aware that tobacco companies have lodged a
                    significant number of freedom-of-information requests in countries considering plain
                    packaging. These requests can be designed to tie up government resources and to be
                    ‘fishing’ exercises in preparation for legal challenges. Governments should consider
                    strategies to prepare themselves to respond to such requests, by developing an approach
                    to document management from the outset.</p>
