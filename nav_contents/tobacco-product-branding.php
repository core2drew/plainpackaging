                <p>Packaging is used for marketing and advertising of most consumer products, including
                    tobacco. If tobacco advertising
                    and promotion tobacco are banned in all other areas, it is simply common sense to ban
                    them on the packaging of
                    tobacco products as well. </p>
                <p>The tobacco industry claims not to target children or non-smokers with their advertising
                    and promotion. This includes
                    with the use of branding on packaging. In fact, the tobacco companies also claim that
                    packaging has no role in
                    advertising and promotion at all and that it has no impact on overall smoking rates.</p>
                <p>This public position of the tobacco companies is contradicted by general marketing theory
                    about the role of packaging
                    as a medium for advertising and promotion. It has been rejected by courts around the
                    world examining the issue. It
                    is also contradicted by the internal industry documents that have been disclosed through
                    litigation.</p>
                <p>These pages provides details about marketing theory, evidence about branding on tobacco
                    packaging and evidence from
                    historical internal industry documentation that provides fundamental support for the
                    need for plain packaging of
                    tobacco products. </p>
                <p>The tobacco industries’ position is that branding on packaging has no impact on smoking
                    initiation. The companies’
                    views are set out in detail on the <b>Opposing Arguments (and how to counter them)</b>

                <h3 class="fc-brown-home sub-title">Tobacco packaging has a number of functions:</h3>
                <p>In addition to containing and protecting a product, packaging assists consumers in
                    identifying brands and
                    distinguishing between competing brands; encourages consumers to switch brands; launches
                    new brands; and enables
                    tobacco manufacturers to build and maintain brand loyalty and command a premium price
                    for its products.
                    <sup>1</sup></p>

                <p><b>Japan Tobacco International</b> (JTI) in its response to the 2012 <i>Consultation on
                        Standardised Packaging of
                        Tobacco</i> in
                    the UK, said:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“In the UK’s system of undistorted competition, businesses must be in a
                    position to communicate to
                    their
                    customers.
                    The UK tobacco market is highly competitive. JTI invests and innovates in its packaging
                    design and quality in order
                    to compete with other products available to existing adult smokers. JTI and other
                    companies, both within the tobacco
                    sector and also in the context of other FMCGs, <sup>2</sup> use product packaging in a
                    myriad of ways, and this
                    scope for
                    creativity motivates efforts to differentiate the product from others.”[emphasis added]
                </p>

                <p>The tobacco industry states that the packaging enables adults who want a particular
                    product (i.e., tobacco) to make
                    an informed decision about which brand to buy. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-brown-home sub-title">The advertising function of packaging: </h3>

                <p>In addition to the practical functions, research indicates that packaging is an important
                    component of overall
                    tobacco-marketing strategy. <sup>3</sup> Tobacco packaging has multiple functions for
                    tobacco companies beyond
                    that of brand
                    identification, navigation, and selection. <b>Tobacco packaging is used to promote the
                        product using the same
                        strategies employed by manufacturers of other consumer goods</b>. </p>

                <h3 class="fc-brown-home sub-title">The importance of packaging as part of the overall
                    promotional mix is recognized in
                    marketing literature: </h3>
                <p>Many of the standard marketing textbooks explain the importance of packaging as a key
                    marketing tool.</p>
                <p>For example, in Marketing Management, Kotler and Keller argue that the packaging is the
                    buyer’s first encounter with
                    the product and that good packaging draws the consumer in and encourages product choice.
                    In effect, packaging can
                    act as “five-second commercials” and is used to “convey persuasive information.” They
                    also state that packaging
                    updates and redesigns can have an immediate impact on sales. <sup>4</sup></p>

                <p>Kotler and Keller highlight the importance of color on packaging and the associations and
                    meanings that different
                    colors generate in different market segments. They reproduce the “Color Wheel of
                    Branding and Packaging,” which sets
                    out for instance, that “Red is a powerful color, symbolizing energy, passion or even
                    danger” and “Green connotes
                    cleanliness, freshness and renewal” while “White . . . connotes purity and cleanliness.”
                    <sup>5</sup></p>

                <p>In the textbook Strategic Brand Management Keller writes:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“Structural packaging innovations can create a point-of-difference that
                    permits a higher margin. New
                    packages can also expand a market and capture new market segments. Packaging changes can
                    have immediate impact on
                    customer shopping behavior and sales. . . ” <sup>6</sup></p>

                <p>It is noteworthy that Professor Keller was used as an expert by PMI in its legal
                    challenge to the UK plain packaging
                    regulations. His evidence was largely unchallenged by the UK government, and the Judge
                    in that case found that
                    elements of his report actually supported the case for plain packaging. <sup>7</sup></p>

                <p>Palmer’s standard textbook, The Principles of Marketing, states that packaging “act(s) as
                    a promotional tool in its
                    own right.” <sup>8</sup></p>
                <p>Underwood and Ozanne write that the “product package is the communication life-blood of
                    the firm” or the “silent
                    salesman that reaches out to customers.” <sup>9</sup></p>
                <p>In studies of tobacco marketing, Ford et al. say that it has been suggested that
                    packaging should be the fifth “p” of
                    the marketing mix model as it is the only element of the marketing mix intertwined with
                    all of the other “p’s”
                    (product development, pricing, placement and distribution, and promotion), and that it
                    plays a key role in all of
                    these strategic marketing areas. Indeed, highlighting the importance attached to
                    packaging, it is positioned as a
                    standalone marketing mix element, the fifth “p,” for British American Tobacco.

                <h3 class="fc-brown-home sub-title">When tobacco advertising is prohibited, packaging becomes
                    the primary means of
                    marketing: </h3>
                <p>As a BAT marketing executive put it:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“Our final communication vehicle with our smoker is the pack itself.In
                    the absence of any other

                    Put another way — when you
                    don’t have anything else — our packaging is our marketing.” </p>

                <div id="item2" class="section-secondary-title fc-brown-home">Why tobacco packaging is
                    different to

                    goods
                </div>

                <h3 class="fc-brown-home sub-title">Tobacco packaging is defined as a “badge” product in
                    tobacco industry marketing

                <p>
                    Badge products enable elements of the brand image to be transferred to the user through
                    public displays of the pack.
                    This is especially applicable to tobacco as smokers keep their packs close by and reveal
                    them countless times every
                    day. Such behaviors expose other consumers to the brand — something termed “incidental
                    consumer brand encounters
                    (ICBEs)” by Ferraro, Bettman, and Chartrand (2009). <sup>13</sup> These ICBEs can have a
                    powerful influence on
                    brand choice,
                    even
                    when the consumer is unaware of being exposed to the brand. <sup>14</sup>
                </p>

                <p>Sir Cyril Chantler was provided evidence on tobacco packaging being a badge product
                    during his evidence review. He
                    stated that: </p>

                <p class="p-states">“Public health experts argue that packaging of tobacco products is especially able to
                    play a promotional role because
                    unlike many other products, they are <b>constantly being taken out and opened, as well
                        as being left on public

                        during use [and] in this way cigarette packaging can act as an
                        advertisement</b>.”<sup>15</sup></p>

                <p><img style="height:300px;" class="img-responsive text-center" src="<?php echo $base_url; ?>img/reference-materials/A57TPH.jpg"></p>

                <p>In addition to public health experts, the tobacco industry has said a lot about the
                    importance of tobacco packaging.
                    An employee of Brown and Williamson was quoted in 1985 as saying,</p>

                <p class="p-states">“. . . if you smoke, a cigarette pack is one of the few things you use
                    regularly that makes a
                    statement about you. A cigarette pack is the only thing you take out of your pocket 20
                    times a day and lay out for
                    everyone to see. That’s a lot different than buying your soap powder in generic
                    packaging.” </p>

                <h3 class="fc-brown-home sub-title">Tobacco packaging serves as an integral component of
                    tobacco marketing: </h3>
                <p>According to Professor Hammond:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“. . . the pack provides a direct link be¬tween consumers and
                    manufacturers, and is particularly
                    important for consumer products such as cigarettes, which have a high degree of social
                    visibility. Unlike many other
                    consumer products, cigarette pack¬ages are displayed each time the product is used and
                    are often left in pub¬lic
                    view between uses. As a result, both smokers and non-smokers report high levels of
                    exposure to tobacco packaging . .

                    influences youth smoking: </h3>

                <p>In 2009, the Public Health Research Consortium (PHRC) in the UK published a review of
                    young people and smoking
                    <sup>19</sup>.
                    The
                    review found that the onset of smoking is a function of individual factors (e.g., self
                    image), social and community
                    factors (e.g., family circumstances), and societal factors (e.g., tobacco marketing).
                    Interventions, therefore, need
                    to address all these domains. </p>

                <p>One of the conclusions of the PHRC’s review was that <b>“tobacco marketing continues to
                        be a major
                        problem. Notwithstanding the proven success of the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion
                        [laws], tobacco brands are
                        still
                        influencing youth smoking</b>. The key remaining transmitters of this branding are
                    point of sale (PoS) presence
                    and the
                    pack.” The review found that the tobacco industry is exploiting the pack as a medium for
                    advertising the product and
                    reinforcing the brand. It was concluded that generic packaging is an essential next step
                    (PHRC 2009). </p>

                <p>The Chantler Review <sup>20</sup> has an entire section devoted to reviewing the evidence

                <p>His conclusion was that packaging does act as one of the factors encouraging young people
                    to take up smoking:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“In my opinion, <b>the balance of evidence suggests that the appeal of
                        branded packaging acts as

                        the factors encouraging children and young adults to experiment with tobacco and to
                        establish and continue a
                        habit
                        of smoking</b>. As British American Tobacco Australia’s spokesman acknowledged in
                    our meeting, tobacco
                    companies, like
                    other consumer goods companies, see branded packaging as one of the tools of marketing.
                    This is supported by
                    numerous internal tobacco industry documents. Although the tobacco industry says that
                    the purpose of branded
                    packaging is to encourage brand switching only, they cannot explain how it would only
                    ever attract switchers from
                    one brand to another, and would never encourage initiation from non-smokers or increased
                    overall consumption.
                    Further, they have not been able to explain why, given that advertising and promotion
                    are proven to increase tobacco
                    consumption, the related marketing tool of branded packaging (referred to by Japan
                    Tobacco International’s counsel
                    against the Australian Government as their mobile “billboard”) should so differ in its
                    effect.”</p>

                <p>He described the evidence regarding the tobacco industry’s attempts to make packaging
                    appeal to different sections of
                    the population, including young adults, and considers that a “spillover” effect is
                    likely:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“I have seen considerable evidence of tobacco companies carrying out
                    market research on all aspects
                    of packaging (e.g. colour, size, shape and opening) to make it appeal to various target
                    groups of young adults. In
                    my opinion a <b>“spillover effect”</b> (as described by tobacco control experts) is
                    extremely plausible, whereby
                    packages
                    that are meticulously designed to appeal to, say, an 18 year old, are highly likely to
                    appeal to a 16 year old.
                    Because 16 year olds look up to 18 year olds and want to emulate them, in my view it is
                    not possible to design
                    packages in such a way as to appeal solely to one group without also appealing to the
                    other. Research looking at the
                    link between branded and innovative packaging and childhood and young adulthood smoking
                    susceptibility bears this
                    out, describing an <b>“inevitable knock on effect”</b> of targeting product design at
                    young adults.”</p>

                <p>The involvement of tobacco companies in orientating marketing activities towards young
                    people in the United States
                    was described by Kaufman et al: </p>

                <p class="p-states">“The tobacco industry states that its purpose in tobacco marketing is to
                    maintain brand loyalty and
                    not to encourage adolescent smoking, arguing that susceptibility to cigarette use is
                    chiefly the result of influence
                    by family members and/or peers. <b>The documents released as a result of the Minnesota

                    Settlement Agreement between state attorneys general and the tobacco companies confirm
                    that the tobacco industry

                        recognition of the 14 to 18-year-old
                        consumers as a growing segment of the smoking population critical to the industry's
                        long-term performance and
                        profitability.</b> <sup>21</sup>” </p>

                <p>On tobacco promotion and packaging, the US Surgeon General summarized evidence in 2012
                    and 2014 and concluded that,
                    “The evidence is sufficient to conclude that advertising and promotional activities by
                    the tobacco companies cause
                    the onset and continuation of smoking among adolescents and young adults.” <sup>22</sup>
                </p>

                <p>Chantler believed that the evidence shows that, more specifically, branding can influence
                    consumption of goods:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“I find it significant that in other consumer goods markets, where
                    children can safely be allowed to
                    participate in experiments, it has been proven that appealing branding does influence
                    consumption. . . . Clearly,
                    given the risks even of being exposed to tobacco marketing, let alone experimenting with
                    smoking, it would never be
                    possible to gain ethical consent for similar experiments with tobacco products. However,
                    lessons can be learned from
                    the experiments that have taken place in different contexts.”</p>

                <p>Kaufman et al. found that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion not only
                    increases an adolescent's knowledge
                    of cigarettes, but also increases susceptibility to tobacco use and the likelihood of
                    experimentation and
                    initiation. <sup>23</sup></p>

                <p>Moodie et al. <sup>24</sup> summarized the different research undertaken on tobacco
                    advertising and smoking uptake
                    by young
                    people
                    and found that:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“Although, the tobacco industry vehemently denies targeting young
                    people, internal tobacco industry
                    documents from the United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan reveal that it does, and
                    indeed that tobacco companies
                    depend on the youth smoking market for their long-term survival. Research has
                    consistently revealed that tobacco
                    advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke
                    . . . <b>Furthermore, we
                        know
                        that tobacco branding is continuing to drive UK teen smoking even after [the
                        advertising ban]</b>.”</p>

                <p>Conventional tobacco advertising is banned in the many countries in line with the FCTC
                    Article 11. Branded packaging
                    is therefore used by the tobacco industry to communicate information to consumers.
                    According to Chantler:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“Branded packaging is seen by the industry as an important way to
                    communicate the quality and
                    product characteristics to consumers, to encourage smokers to maintain their
                    identification with their chosen brand.
                    This appears to be particularly important in the absence of advertising or point of sale
                    display. This is borne out
                    by legal representatives of Japan Tobacco International in proceedings in the Australian
                    High Court, stating that
                    the Commonwealth ‘is acquiring our billboard, your Honour, in effect.’” <sup>25</sup>
                </p>

                <p>The evidence review prepared for the Irish Department of Health by Professor Hammond also
                    concluded that:</p>

                <p class="p-states"><b>“Packaging has a powerful influence in establishing brand imagery and

                        youth
                        and young adults — the critical period when the vast majority of smoking initiation
                        occurs</b>. Corporate
                    documents from
                    tobacco companies indicate that packages have been designed to appeal to “starters” as
                    part of a deliberate
                    marketing strategy to recruit new smokers. The evidence indicates that “plain” packaging
                    is unequivocally less
                    appealing and less socially desirable to youth and young adults. Plain packaging is also
                    associated with less
                    positive brand imagery, including smoker traits, such as cool, stylish, thin, as well as
                    less desirable product
                    associations.”</p>

                <div id="item4" class="section-secondary-title fc-brown-home">Plain packaging “denormalizes”
                    smoking
                </div>

                <p class="fc-brown-home">If smoking is seen by young people as a normal part of everyday life, they are much more
                    likely to become smokers
                    themselves. </p>

                <p>In its 2008 Board of Science Report Forever Cool, the British Medical Association
                    suggested that:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“The way tobacco is perceived and how this integrates with self image is
                    a crucial determinant of
                    youth
                    smoking. With
                    the exception of tobacco marketing, these influences are often subtle and unintentional.
                    The combination of
                    circumstances prevails to create an environment in which both the prevalence and
                    acceptability of smoking become
                    exaggerated and eases the transition into the habit.”</p>

                <p>Social norms were also suggested in 2012 by the US Surgeon General as being important in
                    influencing smoking by young
                    people:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“Peer influences; imagery and messages that por¬tray tobacco use as a
                    desirable activity; and
                    environmental cues, including those in both traditional and emerging media platforms,
                    all encourage young people to
                    use tobacco. These influences help attract youth to tobacco use and reinforce the
                    perception that smoking and
                    various forms of tobacco use are a social norm — a particularly strong message during
                    adolescence and young
                    adulthood.”</p>

                <p>The benefits of shaping social norms on smoking could be dramatic, with research
                    suggesting that if the average
                    individual’s views on the social acceptability of smoking changed to more closely
                    resemble the views of Californian
                    residents, <sup>28</sup> there would be a 15 percent drop in cigarette consumption.
                    <sup>29</sup></p>

                <p>Hoek et al. defined “denormalization” and discussed how standardized packaging could be
                    an element of such a
                    strategy:</p>

                <p class="p-states">“. . . tobacco “denormalisation”, exposes tobacco as a toxic product
                    peddled by an unscrupulous
                    industry and undermines the social cachet of smoking. Denormalisation reframes smoking
                    as socially unacceptable and
                    challenges the connotations of glamour, sophistication and ruggedness that tobacco
                    brands have used to attract young
                    people. Over time, denormalisaton reduces smoking’s aspirational attributes, undermines
                    the value tobacco brands
                    deliver to smokers and reduces tobacco consumption.</p>

                <p class="p-states">“Plain packaging extends this approach by moving beyond smokefree social
                    marketing campaigns to
                    focus directly on tobacco packages, which represent a tangible symbol the emotional
                    benefits smokers derive from
                    “their” brand. These measures reflect increased knowledge of the role that packaging
                    plays in promoting smoking, the
                    meticulous research undertaken into branding by tobacco companies, and the tobacco
                    industry’s growing reliance on
                    packaging as a promotion as traditional mass media becomes more restricted.”

                <p class="fc-brown-home">Branding enables tobacco manufacturers to sell status, social acceptance, and glamour,

                <p>Marketing theory explains how brands function by linking aspirations, attributes, and
                    values to products and
                    services, which consumers buy as much for their symbolic value as for their utility.

                    with one document setting out that, “In the cigarette category brand image is
                    everything. The brand of cigarettes a

                <p>As tobacco is a relatively homogeneous market with little functional difference between

                    is strategically important as the predominant means of product differentiation. Pack

                    facilitate the adding of value to brands, primarily through the use of imagery and
                    association. Things like pack
                    opening, size, shape, and graphic design are aimed at communicating to the market the
                    type of customer you imagine
                    would smoke a certain brand. <sup>34</sup> Brand choice has little to do with the actual
                    cigarette but with
                    linking the

                <p>Quantitative research from Australia has recently confirmed that reducing strong brand
                    identity can lead to reduced

                    their brand, positive brand stereotypes, quitting behaviors and intentions, and smoking

                    initially identified strongly with their brand, experienced a significant decrease in
                    their brand identity following
                    the introduction of plain packaging and this was associated with lower smoking behaviors
                    and increased intentions to
                    quit. The findings provide the first quantitative evidence that brand identities may
                    help maintain smoking
                    behavior. <sup>36</sup></p>

                <div id="item6" class="section-secondary-title fc-brown-home">Branding on tobacco packaging
                    is
                    intended
                    to mislead consumers
                </div>

                <p>Tobacco companies have made extensive use of tobacco packaging to convey misleading
                    information about the relative
                    harms of different brands. The use of descriptors such as “light,” “mild,” and “low tar”
                    and how this misleads
                    consumers have been reviewed and extensively documented. <sup>37</sup> Equally well
                    known is that “lower tar”
                    cigarettes are
                    not
                    actually lower in tar but cause the same harms as regular cigarettes. These health
                    reassurance brands have the
                    psychological effect of convincing smokers that they are less harmful, leading to them
                    swapping brands instead of
                    making quit attempts. The FCTC Article 11.1(a) requires parties to ensure that packaging
                    does not mislead or create
                    erroneous impressions and recommends banning those terms — to date at least 79 countries
                    have prohibited descriptors
                    such as “light,” “mild,” and “low tar.” <sup>38</sup></p>

                <p>However, research in Australia and the UK, where these terms have been prohibited,
                    suggests only modest benefits in
                    reducing false beliefs about the risks of different cigarette brands. <sup>39</sup> This
                    marginal impact is likely
                    due to
                    greater
                    color segmentation and the substitution of other misleading terms, such as “smooth.”
                </p>

                <p>It is also well documented that when countries have banned misleading descriptors such as
                    “light” and “mild” these
                    brand variants were replaced with color descriptors, such as “gold” and “silver” with
                    the pack colors and branding
                    remaining identical. </p>

                    consumers
                    about the harms of tobacco.
                </div>

                <p>Industry documents describe the specific importance of pack color in shaping consumer
                    perceptions of risk. For
                    example, British American Tobacco’s Research & Development group summarized principles
                    for effective pack design and
                    noted that: </p>

                <p class="p-states">“Lower delivery products tend to be featured in blue packs. Indeed, as
                    one moves down the delivery
                    sector then the closer to white a pack tends to become. This is because white is
                    generally held to convey a clean,
                    healthy association.” <sup>41</sup></p>

                <p>Different shades of the same color and the proportion of “white space” on the package are
                    commonly used to manipulate
                    perceptions of a product’s relative strength and potential risk. </p>

                <p>Industry research demonstrates that the color and design of the package are so effective
                    that they even influence
                    sensory perceptions from smoking a cigarette. For example, when consumers smoke
                    cigarettes placed in lighter-colored
                    packs, they perceive these cigarettes to taste “lighter” and less harsh than the same
                    cigarettes presented in
                    darker-colored packs. <sup>42</sup></p>

                <div class="section-secondary-title fc-brown-home">Anchor brands
                </div>

                <p>Extensive research on “anchoring” shows that the presence of an anchor brand against
                    which brand variants can be
                    compared (either physically or in people’s minds) leads to distortions in perception and
                    judgment. For instance, the
                    presence of fried cheese bites as an anchor leads people to judge a cheeseburger as a
                    more healthy option because it
                    benefits from a contrast effect. Brand variants such as Marlboro “Blue” and “Gold” are
                    contrasted against the parent
                    brand/anchor Marlboro “Red” and are incorrectly seen as lower risk products. Therefore,
                    the presence of a full
                    flavor/higher tar parent brand together with its brand variants (positioned to be at
                    lower risk on a health
                    continuum) strongly promotes increased, and false, health reassurance owing to
                    contrast-based distortions in
                    perception and judgment.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The tobacco industries’ position on whether packaging encourages smoking or not is set
                    out in detail on the Opposing
                    Arguments (and how to counter them) page of the Tools and Resources.That section draws
                    ontobacco company submissions
                    to government consultations and their court pleadings in legal challenges to plain
                    packaging in the UK.</p>

                <p>In brief, the tobacco industry claims not to target children or non-smokers with their
                    advertising and promotion. The
                    tobacco companies also state that packaging has no role in advertising and
                    promotion. </p>

                <p>They seek to blur or ignore the overwhelming view of marketing theory and evidence that
                    advertising and marketing
                    affects overall consumption of a product. The tobacco companies take this view publicly
                    despite all the disclosed
                    internal tobacco industry documents that demonstrate a contrary view is held within the
                    companies (see below).</p>

                <p>Tobacco companies argue that branding on packaging only promotes brand switching by
                    current smokers and has no effect
                    on overall primary demand. They state that branded packaging does not cause people to
                    start or continue smoking.</p>

                <p>The tobacco industry claims that there is evidence that factors other than branded
                    packaging are the real drivers of
                    smoking initiation. </p>

                <p>The tobacco companies’ position on branding has been rejected by courts in many
                    countries, most recently in the UK by
                    the High Court judge hearing the legal challenge to plain packaging regulations. He
                    stated: </p>

                <p class="p-states">“This argument is unsustainable. It is not possible to design a product
                    to appeal to adults (over
                    18s) without appealing, even inadvertently, to children. A number of the tobacco
                    companies have strenuously denied
                    that they target their product on children or even that they are interested in the
                    impact of tobacco on children.
                    But the Government medical advisers all say that, targeted or not, the lure to children

                    Packaging is an important component of the overall marketing strategy for consumer
                    goods. Packaging
                    is particularly important for consumer products with a high degree of social visibility,
                    such as cigarettes. Unlike
                    many other consumer products, cigarettes are contained in packages that are displayed
                    each time the product is used
                    and are often left in public view between uses.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Tobacco industry research and marketing documents unequivocally demonstrate the
                    importance of tobacco packaging as a
                    marketing tool. For example, a recent presentation to global investors identified
                    packaging and limited edition
                    packs as a key component of industry innovation and growth. A variety of documents also
                    discuss packaging within the
                    context of recruiting new smokers. For example, a summary of consumer product testing
                    prepared by Philip Morris
                    stated: “<b>Advertising, packaging, price can get people to try a product . . .</b>”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    A review of marketing for Marlboro Red and Marlboro Lights highlights the role of <b>packaging
                        in brand
                        communication,
                        as well as how packaging strategies can help address challenges in recruiting more
                        ‘starters</b>.’
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Corporate documents indicate that the importance of packaging increases in jurisdictions
                    with comprehensive
                    advertising and marketing restrictions, such as [Australia, Ireland, France or the UK].
                    As a BAT marketing executive
                    put it, ‘Our final communication vehicle with our smoker is the pack itself.’
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    A BAT internal review of trends in cigarette packaging in the 1990’s predicted that:
                    ‘Advertising and promotion bans
                    and restrictions will rapidly increase. The pack will increasingly become the main
                    communicator.’ An earlier BAT
                    document from 1979 on new opportunities in marketing elaborated:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <span class="indented">“Under conditions of total ban, pack designs and the brand house and company 'livery' have enormous importance in reminding and reassuring the smokers. Therefore the most effective symbols, designs, colour schemes, graphics and other brand identifiers should be carefully researched so as to find out which best convey the elements of goodwill and image. Where necessary, new designs must be created and tested so as to enhance and complement the identifiers. An objective should be to enable packs, by themselves, to convey the total product message.”</span>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    A 1987 summary of Philip Morris’s “International Social Acceptability Research” program
                    also highlights the growing
                    importance of packaging as a promotional tool:
                    <span class="indented">“The following key elements are of prime importance in the enhancement of the smoker’s self-perceptions: the package, including brand name, logo, colour, design, crest, box, soft pack, etc . . . . <b>As media restrictions continue to increase in many major world markets, our packaging becomes increasingly important as: a vehicle for communication, a statement about the smoker’s personality and lifestyle, an expression of social acceptability.</b>”</span>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    [Tobacco packaging plays a fundamental role in communicating brand imagery]. For
                    example, a confidential document
                    from BAT’s Group Research & Development Centre, describes the central role of the pack
                    in conveying brand imagery:
                    <span class="indented">“Historically, <b>cigarette pack design has assumed a great deal of importance in the marketing process. This is because brand imagery is salient in the mind of the consumer</b> . . . . Much of the imagery has traditionally been developed through advertising. However, it has been understood that this imagery must be carried right through to the brand . . . . The main focus of attention, therefore, has been on the pack which carries the product.”</span>

                    <br/>
                    <b>Brand imagery is particularly important in targeting youth and young adults</b>. In
                    many cases, initial brand
                    preferences are based less on the sensory properties of using the product than on
                    perceptions of the package and
                    brand:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <span class="indented">“. . . one of every two smokers is not able to distinguish in blind (masked) tests between similar cigarettes . . . . for most smokers and for the decisive group of new, younger smokers, the consumer’s choice is dictated more by psychological, image factors than by relatively minor differences in smoking characteristics.”</span>
                    <b>Tobacco company research indicates that brand imagery is critical to segmenting
                        brands and targeting sub-groups,
                        such as young women.</b>
                    <span class="indented">“As in previous studies, the pack generated a very positive response from respondents. They praised it for its delicate prettiness and its classy femininity. And they were attracted to its “simple” and “clean” design . . . . The slim size of the pack was generally seen as clear benefit: it fits a woman’s hand better and takes up less room in her purse . . . . User Imagery: After viewing the pack and carton, respondents tended to develop the same general user imagery that has been found in previous studies. They see Capri as a cigarette that is unambiguously for women . . . . But when asked for specific imagery, they tend to imagine the typical Capri smokers as . . . tasteful and fashion-conscious . . . confident and independent.”</span>

                    Color is among the most important packaging attributes for establishing brand imagery.
                    Tobacco companies conduct
                    extensive market research on the effect of colors. For exam¬ple, silver and gold can be
                    used to convey status and
                    prestige, particularly for “premium” brands. Red packages and logos can convey
                    excitement, strength, wealth, and
                    power, whereas pastel colors are associated with freshness, innocence, and relaxation,
                    and are more common among
                    brands that appeal to females.

                </div>
                <p>A useful and comprehensive study by Cancer Council Victoria of tobacco packaging in
                    Australia before plain packaging
                    was introduced explores the concept of packaging as a promotional tool and describes
                    trends in the packaging of
                    cigarettes and other tobacco products:</p>

                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-11-advertising/11-10-tobacco-display-as-advertising1">Packaging
                        as promotion. In Tobacco in Australia: Facts and issues</a> <sup>46</sup></p>

                <p>There is sound evidence from wider marketing literature regarding the role of packaging
                    in the promotion strategy for
                    any consumer good. Evidence suggests that packaging and branding work hand in hand.
                    Marketing theory explains how
                    brands function by linking aspirations, attributes, and values to products and services,
                    which consumers buy as much
                    for their symbolic value as for their utility.</p>

                <p>Tobacco packaging is different to packaging for other consumer goods. Tobacco packs are
                    carried around by smokers and
                    are on regular display. This makes the pack both a mobile advertisement as well as
                    making a statement about the
                    person who carries and displays it.</p>

                <p>For tobacco, packaging is now a vital way for tobacco companies to promote their
                    products, as legislation in many
                    countries prohibiting tobacco advertising and promotion has closed down other
                    promotional avenues. Tobacco companies
                    have introduced many more brands variants once tobacco advertising bans have been put in
                    place, and it is said that
                    they have invested a great deal in bringing innovative and attractive packaging to the
                    market. Tobacco companies
                    contest this view, however, arguing that this is a known feature of consumer goods where
                    the market is “mature,
                    saturated and declining.” Tobacco companies also strongly argue that the branding on
                    packaging is aimed at
                    encouraging existing smokers to switch brands and that there is no evidence that it has
                    any effect on initial take
                    up. </p>

                <p><b>Despite the vast sums of money invested in brands and packaging, the tobacco industry
                        will continue to deny that
                        packaging and branding have any effect on overall smoking rates; claim that the only
                        purpose of branding is to
                        identify and distinguish a product; and argue that branding only has an impact on
                        market share</b></p>

                    According to the California
                    Department of Public Health, the California Tobacco Control Program was established by
                    the Tobacco Tax and Health
                    Promotion Act of 1988. The act, which was approved by California voters, instituted a
                    25-cent tax on each pack of
                    cigarettes and earmarked 5 cents of that tax to fund California’s tobacco control
                    efforts. These efforts include
                    funding local health departments and community organizations, an aggressive media
                    campaign and tobacco-related
                    evaluation and surveillance. California’s comprehensive approach has changed social
                    norms around tobacco-use and
                    secondhand smoke which have produced dramatic results. Available from:
