                </div>
                <p>
                    The tobacco industry relies heavily on its claim that plain packaging will increase the
                    illicit trade in tobacco. The argument is one of the main issues raised in its media
                    campaigns, in its submissions to government, and in its legal arguments before the courts.
                    However, this claim lacks both logic and evidence. It is made in three ways:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Plain packs will be easier and cheaper to counterfeit than the existing complex branded
                        packs;
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Smokers prefer branded packs and are more like to purchase illicit tobacco that has
                        branded packaging if legal tobacco is in plain packs; and
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Illicit trade in tobacco has increased in Australia after the implementation of plain
                        packaging.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The tobacco industry commissions statistical data on the illicit trade in tobacco for many
                    countries, often using the flawed “empty pack” survey method. In each country that has
                    considered plain packaging, the tobacco companies promote media articles raising fears about
                    illicit tobacco. Leaked internal documents from Philip Morris show this was a central pillar
                    of their strategy to oppose the policy<sup>1</sup>
                    Research shows that the tobacco industry uses inflated estimates of illicit
                    trade.<sup>2</sup>
                </p>

                <br>&nbsp;<br>
                <p>
                    For example, in the UK, research has shown that in the two years before plain packaging
                    proposals were announced, there were no media articles about the illicit trade in tobacco.
                    In the two years after plain packaging was first proposed, 52 stories appeared in the media
                    about rising rates of illicit tobacco, all of which cited tobacco industry data rather than
                    the official government statistics, which showed the rates were declining. <sup>3</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A similar situation occurred in Slovenia with many news articles raising concerns about
                    smuggled cigarettes appearing during the period when the government was considering plain
                    packaging.
                    <sup>4</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The industry then links these concerns about the illicit trade to argue against plain
                    packaging laws. In some countries, tobacco companies have even produced short promotional
                    films <sup>5</sup>
                    that raise fears about crime and terrorism, which they say will result from plain packaging.<sup>6</sup>

                        myth
                        that plain packaging of tobacco will increase illicit trade is promoted strongly by
                        the

                        response</a> to the most recent consultation on plain packaging in Canada <sup>7</sup>
                    provides a
                    typical example of the industry arguments. It stated:
                </p>

                <p class="p-states">
                    “In a plain pack environment, illegal producers will benefit at the expense of legitimate
                    industry. They would be able to replicate easily plain packs and continue to supply the
                    Canadian market with illegal branded packs and clear plastic baggies of cigarettes without
                    health warnings. “ [p. 3]
                </p>

                <p>
                    JTI’s submission relied only on industry funded, discredited data about the extent of
                    contraband tobacco in Canada. It ignored the independent research and official data that
                    shows the illicit market has decreased in recent years. <sup>8</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    JTI also asserted that plain packs will be easier to counterfeit [paragraph 148]. The only
                    research cited is a report from 2012, commissioned by JTI, by Zimmerman and
                    Chaudhary,<sup>9</sup>
                    which
                    has been the subject of academic criticism <sup>10</sup>. There is no independent
                    peer-reviewed
                    research
                    to back up JTI’s argument.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JTI also claims that:
                </p>

                <p class="p-states">
                    “The level of illegal tobacco consumption in Australia has grown more than 20% since plain
                    packaging was introduced.” [paragraph 149]
                </p>

                <p>
                    To support this assertion JTI relied solely on data from a report by KPMG. That study uses
                    an “empty pack” survey, which has been shown to have significant flaws in its methodology
                    . <sup>12</sup>
                    Even that KPMG survey has found no counterfeit plain packs over four years. KPMG has written
                    to the UK Public Health Minister to state that the report has been “misrepresented by
                    others, without our consent, to suggest it supports the contention that plain paper
                    packaging could lead of itself to an increase in tobacco smuggling and duty avoidance.”
                    <sup>13</sup>
                    JTI
                    ignored the official statistics and research that demonstrates the levels of illicit trade
                    has remained constant (see below).

                        and tax stamps on genuine packs; neither of these is changed by plain packaging. In
                        addition, the legislation requires colorful picture health warnings so plain packs are
                        not literally “plain” and are no easier to counterfeit.
