                <p>
                    Big tobacco argues that plain packaging will negatively impact small retailers and that it
                    will increase transaction times for serving tobacco.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Australia, the UK, and France, the tobacco companies argued that plain packaging would
                    have negative impacts on small retailers. The industry regularly provides funds to national
                    retailer associations <sup>1</sup>, and those associations then oppose tobacco control
                    regulation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For instance, in Australia, a study commissioned by the Alliance of Australian Retailers
                    (AAR) concluded that:
                </p>

                <p class="p-states">
                    “retailing times would be adversely affected if standardised packaging were introduced by an
                    additional 15 to 45 seconds per transaction and that the effect would be particularly
                    significant for smaller retailers.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The AAR set up a website to oppose plain packaging (a screen shot is shown below). However,
                    the AAR was a tobacco industry front group financed by Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, and
                    British American Tobacco (BAT). Internal tobacco industry and AAR documents that were leaked
                    to the media revealed that the Alliance was set up and run by the tobacco industry to lobby
                    against plain packaging <sup>2</sup>. This is an example of Astroturfing, a campaign
                    pretending to
                    be a
                    grassroots initiative, while hiding its true origin, goal, and funding.
                </p>

                <br>&nbsp;<br>

                <p>
                    Similarly, in the UK, the tobacco industry funded a campaign run by the Tobacco Retailers
                    Alliance that claimed to be a “coalition of 26,000 independent shopkeepers,” but which was
                    established by the industry to oppose tobacco-control measures. ,<sup>3</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <a href="http://www.jti.com/files/4013/4149/4323/Packaging_Response.pdf">JTI submission
                        to the UK 2012 consultation</a> on plain packaging stated that:
                </p>

                <p class="indented italic">
                    “plain packaging will have significant negative effects on retailers. <u>Transaction times
                        will
                        increase</u>. Margins will be eroded by further downtrading. As tobacco products make up
                    a
                    significant proportion of the turnover of many small retailers, plain packaging may have
                    significant cash-flow and credit implications for them.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The
                    <a href="http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/National_Federation_of_Retail_Newsagents#Submission_to_the_Consultation_on_Plain_Packaging">National
                        Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN)</a>, which receives funds from the tobacco
                    industry, also made submissions to that consultation. It went even further by arguing that
                    plain packaging will:
                </p>

                <p class="p-states">
                    “significantly increase transaction times and costs in shops as it will take staff twice as
                    long to retail tobacco products and worryingly, it will significantly increase retailers’
                    vulnerability to crime while they are increasingly distracted retailing tobacco
                    products.” <sup>4
                    </sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The NFRN was extremely vocal in its opposition to plain packaging and produced postcards
                    that were placed in retail outlets across the UK with misleading images of white plain
                    packs, suggesting that plain packaging legislation will lead to increases in illicit trade,
                    organized crime and terrorism, loss of tax revenue, and more children smoking:. <sup>5</sup>

                <p>
                    However, the strong evidence from Australia is that plain packaging has had no real impact
                    on small retailers. This may be the reason why this argument was not used by either JTI or
                    Imperial Tobacco in their consultation responses to the Canadian 2016 consultation.
