                <p class="p-states">
                    “Plain packaging will require the government to compensate tobacco companies and will cost
                    the UK taxpayers billions of pounds.” [p. 24]
                </p>

                <p>
                    These tobacco company consultation responses, and a number of the other ones listed
                    <b>here</b> , set out in some detail their legal objections to plain packaging. The
                    multinational
                    tobacco companies have brought legal challenges against plain packaging laws in national,
                    regional, and international courts and tribunals. <i>All of these have so far been
                        dismissed</i>.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The legal claims are detailed on the <b>Case Summaries</b> page of the Tools and Resources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the cases that were dismissed in the UK and French administrative courts, the tobacco
                    companies argued that plain packaging breaches national trademark law; breaches rights, such
                    as freedom of expression and freedom to conduct a business; and violates a number of the
                    World Trade Organization agreements, intellectual property treaties, and regional free trade
                    agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite all these cases being firmly rejected, the tobacco companies continue to strongly
                    assert that plain packaging is unlawful in their media campaigns and in submissions to
                    government consultations.

                <p>
                    The legal grounds for the tobacco companies’ allegations that plain packaging is unlawful
                    are described in more detail <b>Legal Issues</b> page of the Tools and Resources together
                    with an
                    analysis of why those arguments are fundamentally flawed. In the Tools and Resources there
                    is also a short <b>Policy Briefing Paper</b> that summarizes the legal issues and counter
                    arguments
                    for easy reference.
