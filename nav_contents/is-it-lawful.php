                true?
            </div>
            <p>Plain packaging laws have been upheld as lawful by national, regional and international
                courts and tribunals which have found the arguments put forward by the tobacco companies to
                be flawed.</p>
            <p>Plain packaging is recommended in the implementation guidelines to Article 11 and 13 of the
                WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control – one of the most widely ratified international
                treaties in the world. For more details see here </p>
            <p>If adopted using appropriate national administrative, constitutional and legislative
                arrangements then there is no inherent reason why plain packaging should be found
                unlawful.</p>

            <div class="section-secondary-title">Does plain packaging of tobacco products breach
                intellectual property laws?
            </div>

            <p>The tobacco companies argue that once they have registered their trademarks they have a
                ‘right to use’ those trademarks. But international intellectual property treatiesdeal with
                registration procedures and how trade mark owners can stop others from using their marks.
                International rules do not give the owners of registered trademarks a ‘right to use’ them
                that overrides a states’ powers to regulate for the public good. </p>

            <p>The court rulings dismissing the legal challenges in Australia, France and the United Kingdom
                have all been clear - plain packaging does not breach either domestic or international
                intellectual property laws and obligations.</p>
            <p>The High Court in Australia pointed out that plain packaging is no different in kind from
                other packaging or labelling requirement.</p>
            <p>As far back as 1994, disclosed internal industry documents show that the tobacco companies
                had advice from their own lawyers and from the World Intellectual Property Organisation
                (WIPO), that plain packaging would not contravene the international intellectual property
                rules <sup>8</sup></p>

                    Plain packaging is not ‘justified’, ‘necessary’ or ‘proportionate’

                            authorities
                            have … disregarded a fair balance between the requirements of the public
                            interest and the protection of the right of property” [¶29 translated]

                            conclusion” that plain packaging will be effective. [¶592]

                            attractiveness of tobacco products and to change the perception of
                            consumers”[¶28]

                    Plain packaging is an ‘expropriation’, ‘deprivation’ or ‘acquisition’ of the property
                    rights in their trademarks.
