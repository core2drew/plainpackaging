                intellectual property laws?
            </div>

            <p>The tobacco companies argue that once they have registered their trademarks they have a
                ‘right to use’ those trademarks. But international intellectual property treatiesdeal with
                registration procedures and how trade mark owners can stop others from using their marks.
                International rules do not give the owners of registered trademarks a ‘right to use’ them
                that overrides a states’ powers to regulate for the public good. </p>

            <p>The court rulings dismissing the legal challenges in Australia, France and the United Kingdom
                have all been clear - plain packaging does not breach either domestic or international
                intellectual property laws and obligations.</p>
            <p>The High Court in Australia pointed out that plain packaging is no different in kind from
                other packaging or labelling requirement.</p>
            <p>As far back as 1994, disclosed internal industry documents show that the tobacco companies
                had advice from their own lawyers and from the World Intellectual Property Organisation
                (WIPO), that plain packaging would not contravene the international intellectual property
                rules <sup>8</sup></p>
