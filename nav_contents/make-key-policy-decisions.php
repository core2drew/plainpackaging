            <p>This means the legislation will likely be quite detailed – aiming for simplicity risks the
                tobacco industry developing novel ways to differentiate their products which don’t currently
                exist on the market (<i>see</i> <b>GUIDE 3.2: DRAFTING THE LAW</b>).</p>
            <p>The key initial policy development decisions are listed below.</p>

                    <p><b>The WHO FCTC guidelines to Article 13 imply that plain packaging should be applied
                            to all tobacco products.</b> Failure to include all tobacco products, could
                        result in those products not subject to the requirements gaining market share (in
                        Canada, for instance, flavoured cigarillos became popular after flavoured cigarettes
                        were banned).</p>
                    <p>There must be good policy reasons for any decision to apply the policy to only some
                        products because otherwise there is a risk that a claim would be made that the
                        policy is discriminatory and in violation of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules
                        (<i>see</i> <b>GUIDE 4.3 WTO NOTIFICATIONS</b>). Australia and Ireland’s legislation
                        applies to all tobacco products. However, UK, Norway, France and Hungary apply the
                        legislation to just cigarettes and hand rolled tobacco. Decisions in those countries
                        were made because of the limited prevalence of less common tobacco products such as
                        cigars or pipe tobacco, especially among younger people.</p>

                        Australia an alpha numeric code is permitted that cannot amount to branding.
                        Australia also stipulates the size and shape of the sticks because ‘slim sticks’ can
                        create the impression that they are less harmful. In UK and Ireland, the brand name
                        and variant is permitted in a specified typeface and location on the stick. It is
                        recommended that sticks be regulated because failure to do so could lead to more
                        branding and the use of attractive colours on the cigarette sticks themselves. If
                        sticks are being regulated, then consideration should be given whether to allow the
                        brand name on them or not.</p></div>

            <p><b>Most countries are adopting 20 cigarettes as the minimum individual pack size</b> as part
                of their plain packaging requirement. Australia and the EU also put minimum quantities on
                hand rolled (or roll your own) tobacco per pack (30g). The legislation should also prohibit
                the sale of tobacco in the absence of packaging as this prevents the sale of individual
                cigarettes or bidi’s, a common practice in some countries.</p>
            <p>The principle reason for prohibiting smaller packs and individual sticks is that these are
                cheaper and therefore more accessible to young people and children, and thereby encourage
                smoking initiation and addiction. This element of the measures is in accordance with WH O F

                These other pieces of information (sometimes given as symbols) may already appear on packs.

                    emissions information should not be permitted on packs because emission yields are
                    misleading to consumers.)</i></p>
            <p>A review of existing requirements and legislation (including general consumer laws that apply
                to all product packaging) is recommended to identify which information should continue,
                which should be not be allowed, and whether there is legislation that already permits or
                requires any information on tobacco packaging. This will inform the how the law is
                drafted.</p>

        <div class="content-desc-cont col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
            <div class="section-secondary-title fc-blue">5. Apply only to retail packaging</div>
            <p><b>In order to ensure that the policy is least restrictive, it needs to be aimed at consumers
                    and no wider.</b> Therefore it should be applied to ‘retail packaging’ or only packaging
                that will or could be seen by consumers; rather than ‘in trade’ packaging that is only used
                in warehouses or wholesalers.</p>
            <p>There are good legal reasons for this limitation. Plain packaging is a measure designed to
                merely control the use of tobacco trademarks rather than to completely prohibit the
                trademarks in all circumstances. Applying the measure only to packing that consumers may see
                will assist in defending some of the legal claims the tobacco industry may make against the
                policy.</p>
            <p>In some countries small shop keepers use the large boxes that are normally only used in
                warehouses and which may not fall within a definition of ‘retail packaging’. In such
                situations, where consumers may be exposed to branding on what is normally ‘trade
                packaging’, a government may consider extending the application of the law and if so,
                different ways of drafting the legislation can be developed and CTFK can assist or advice on
                possible options.</p>

                periods
            </div>
            <p><b>Manufacturers and retailers will have existing stock that does not comply with new
                    packaging laws.</b> Sufficient notice of when the law will come into force ensures that
                producers and retailers have sufficient time to sell existing stock before changing
                packaging to comply with the new law. This weakens any industry argument that it has
                suffered loss as a consequence of holding unsold stock. Australia allowed a 3 month sell
                through period for plain packaging, after which old packs could no longer be sold; the UK
                allowed a full year.</p>
            <p>The question of what is a sufficient period of time may differ from country to country.
                Officials should consider what periods have been allowed for previous packaging
                requirements, such as changes to health warnings.</p>

                subsequent regulations
            </div>
            <p><b>It is recommended that new and specific legal authority is obtained from the legislature
                    or parliament to implement the policy, rather than relying on existing Ministerial or
                    executive powers.</b></p>
            <p>A parliamentary Act could provide simple powers so that the Minister of Health can later
                adopt regulations or a decree that set out the detailed requirement; or the Act could set
                out most of the detailed requirements. This will depend on the style of legislative drafting
                and law-making practices for each country as well as the political situation. A shorter Act,
                or a short provision that is part of a wider tobacco control Act, which just provides simple
                powers may be easier to get through parliament and less subject to political interference.
                On the other hand, if there is doubt as to whether the Minister will move quickly to bring
                in regulations, technical orders or decrees, then it may be better to include the detail in
                the Act and set a legislative timetable for implementation.</p>
            <p>If simple powers are taken it is important they are drafted so as to give authority to
                regulate all aspects of the packaging as well as the appearance of individual tobacco
                products such as cigarette sticks.</p>
