                <p>
                    The tobacco companies make this argument because it is important for some of the legal tests
                    on the justification or proportionality of a regulatory measure. For instance, under Article
                    2.2 of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade agreement, a technical measure should “not be
                    more trade-restrictive than <i>necessary</i> to fulfil a legitimate objective.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The legal test as to whether or not a measure is <i>necessary</i> involves considering if
                    there are
                    less restrictive alternatives that would have an equal effect in achieving the public health
                    objective
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tobacco companies all argue that there are less restrictive measures than plain
                    packaging. The alternatives the companies put forward as being effective and proportionate
                    solutions include:

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Many of the tobacco company consultation submissions listed here include the position that
                    these alternative measures should be introduced instead of plain packaging and that they
                    would be more effective at reducing smoking rates and would be less restrictive on trade and
                    intellectual property rights.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These arguments were also included in the legal challenges to plain packaging regulations in
                    the UK and France.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For instance, in the <a
                        href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bat-v-doh.judgment.pdf">High
                        Court judgment from the UK</a>:
                </p>

                <p class="p-states">
                    “The Claimants submit that the Secretary of State has failed to prove that standardised
                    packaging is proportionate because the evidence does not show that there are no equally
                    effective but less restrictive alternatives …“The Claimants submit that the Secretary of
                    State has failed to prove that standardised packaging is proportionate because <u>the
                        evidence
                        does not show that there are no equally effective but less restrictive alternatives</u>
                    …

                    <br/>

                    PMI contends that there is a less restrictive and more effective alternative policy
                    available to the Government, <u>namely taxation . . . . They rely upon the expert evidence
                        of
                        Professor Mulligan who argued that taxation was a tobacco control policy “that obviously
                        works”</u> . . . . This is “. . . all the Court needs to know to conclude that
                    standardised
                    packaging is unlawful: there is a less restrictive and more effective policy alternative
                    available.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is notable that, in the context of plain packaging, the tobacco companies argue that
                    higher taxation, even in an already high tax market, is a policy that “obviously works” to
                    reduce smoking rates. Where the tobacco companies seek to resist tax increases they argue
                    the opposite.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also notable is that in court PMI, JTI and Imperial all abandoned any reliance on
                    alternative measures being effective other than taxation. Only BAT continued to argue that
                    in addition to tax, numerous alterative, less restrictive and equally effective measures
                    could be introduced.
