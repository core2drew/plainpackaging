                    Plain packaging serves multiple objectives within the broader context of tobacco demand
                    reduction strategies. The broad objectives for plain packaging are to improve public

                    objectives are relevant for them but it is recommended that governments take a broad
                    inclusive approach to the aims they wish to achieve and the means by which they should
                    be achieved through the implementation of plain packaging.</p>
                <p>An important point is that these objectives are evidence-based and capable of being

                <p>It is important that a government sets out the aims for the policy clearly in official,
                    publicly available documents or publications. For example, this can be in the preamble
                    or explanatory notes of the legislation itself (as Australia and Ireland did); in public
                    consultation documents (as the UK and Canada have done); or in a Regulatory Impact

                    It is critical for policy and legal reasons that plain packaging is part of a wider
                    tobacco control strategy that includes:
                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>a comprehensive tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) ban, including
                        a ban on point of sale advertising, and
                    </li>
                    <li>effective graphic health warnings in line with WHO FC TC recommendations.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The reasons for this are:</p>
                <p>
                <div class="section-tertiary-title">Policy issues</div>
                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>It makes little sense to remove the advertising and promotional elements on tobacco
                        packets but still allow advertising or promotion of tobacco products in other ways.
                    </li>
                    <li>One of the key aims of plain packaging is that it increases the noticeability and
                        effectiveness of the Graphic Health Warnings, therefore a country should either have
                        in place, or be introducing concurrently with plain packaging, health warnings that
                        are in line with the recommendations of WHO F C T C Article 11 guidelines – at least
                        50% front and back with graphic pictures.
                    </li>
                    <li>In both Australia and in the EU countries that have introduced plain packaging,
                        health warnings increased in size at the same time plain packaging was introduced.

                <ul class="custom">
                    <li>International legal challenges, as well as many national legal jurisdictions, often
                        include a test of whether it is necessary or justified to introduce a measure that
                        has the potential to restrict trade in goods or commercial activity. This type of
                        legal argument includes consideration of whether there are less restrictive
                        alternative measures that could also meet the policy objectives. If a comprehensive
                        TAPS ban is not in place or being introduced, a court could consider that a TAPS ban
                        may be a less restrictive option for achieving the policy objectives than
                        introducing plain packaging.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tobacco companies could argue that that the efficacy of the policy would be
                        undermined by other forms of advertising.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is significant research evidence that shows plain packaging is effective at
                        increasing the noticeability of health warnings. But without regulations requiring
                        effective health warnings that are in accordance with F C T C recommendations, it
                        would be difficult to use that to support the defence of plain packaging in a legal
                        challenge.
