            <p>The purpose of a regulatory impact analysis is to provide a detailed and systematic appraisal
                of the potential positive and negative impacts of a new law or regulation in order to assess
                whether it is likely to achieve the desired objectives and what the potential unintended
                consequences may be.</p>
            <p>This analysis is not always a necessary requirement and may be unusual for some governments
                for a public health measure. However, an assessment of the predicted economic, social and
                public health impacts can assist with the arguments for proceeding with plain packaging that
                need to be made in government and with the public.</p>
            <p>In both domestic and international courts, the tobacco industry regularly alleges that
                tobacco control laws, especially plain packaging, are arbitrary, not supported by evidence
                and not adopted with proper due process. A regulatory impact analysis can act as an internal
                record of the government’s effective policy development and can help to protect the policy
                against legal challenges.</p>
            <p>In some countries, for instance the UK, an impact assessment is a government requirement for
                any policy that has an impact on business, with specified procedures for how one must be
                produced. In other countries, such as Kenya, there is specific legislation that stipulates
                when a regulatory impact assessment must be carried out and what it must
                contain.<sup>1</sup></p>

                also include undertaking stakeholder input or a public consultation (<i>see</i> <b>Guide
                    2.3</b>). Ultimately it will lead to a recommendation of a preferred option for the

            <p><b>Ireland produced a regulatory impact assessment</b> that looked at the costs and benefits
                of the policy. It concludes that:</p>
            <p><i>“The implementation of this measure together with the other measures outlined in Tobacco
                    Free Ireland would have the benefit of reducing smoking prevalence in Ireland and
                    thereby reducing deaths associated with smoking related diseases. This in turn would
                    reduce the costs to the state related to smoking related diseases. A very conservative
                    estimate of the costs of illness attributable to smoking was in the region of €664
                    million in 2009. The cost of premature mortality in Ireland due to smoking in the same
                    year was estimated at €3.5 billion.”</i><br><a

            </p>
            <p><b>France did not produce an impact assessment</b> and this was used as an argument to
                challenge its legality under the French constitution although the argument was dismissed.
            </p>
            <p><b>New Zealand produced a similar impact assessment</b> to Ireland. It concludes that:</p>
            <p><i>“The status quo does not address the continuing ability of the tobacco industry to use
                    packaging in a way that allows advertising and promotion of tobacco products, despite
                    the ban on tobacco advertising (and other controls). Similarly, though to increase
                    health warning coverage on tobacco packets would reduce the amount of space left on the
                    packet for industry promotions, it does not fully address this gap… Accordingly, this
                    regulatory impact statement recommends that option 3, Regulatory change to require plain
                    packaging of tobacco product.”</i><br><a

            <p><b>The UK produced an economic impact</b> assessment which fully monetised the impact of the
                policy on the UK economy as a whole and concluded that it would lead to a potential <b>£30billion
                    benefit over 10 years compared to a £5billion cost</b> (most of the costs were loss of
                tax revenues from the reduction in tobacco consumption). But the sort of detailed
                calculations undertaken by the UK can be attacked by the tobacco industry as they rely on
                assumption and so even where one is produced, an impact assessment should not be relied on
                as the principle reason for proceeding, but rather one element of the decision making
                process. In legal challenges in the UK, the tobacco industry focussed on what it said were
                flaws in the economic impact assessment (although ultimately the court did not agree with
                the tobacco companies).<br><a
