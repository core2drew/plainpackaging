            <p>The purpose of a regulatory impact analysis is to provide a detailed and systematic appraisal
                of the potential positive and negative impacts of a new law or regulation in order to assess
                whether or not it is likely to achieve the desired objectives and what the potential unintended
                consequences may be.</p>
            <p>This analysis is not always a necessary requirement and may be unusual for some governments
                for a public health measure. However, an assessment of the predicted economic, social, and
                public health impacts can assist with the arguments for proceeding with plain packaging that
                need to be made by the in government and with the public.</p>
            <p>In both domestic and international courts, the tobacco industry regularly alleges that
                tobacco control laws, especially plain packaging, are arbitrary, not supported by evidence,
                and not adopted with proper due process. A regulatory impact analysis can act as an internal
                record of the government’s effective policy development and can help to protect the policy
                against legal challenges.</p>
            <p>In some countries, for instance the UK, an impact assessment is a government requirement for
                any policy that has an impact on business with specified procedures for how one must be
                produced. In other countries, such as Kenya, there is specific legislation that stipulates
                when a regulatory impact assessment must be carried out and what it must
                contain.<sup>1</sup></p>
            <p>There is a draft template for a regulatory
                impact assessment <a href="<?php echo $base_url; ?>policy-tools/regulatory-impact-analysis-ref">included
                    in the Tools and Resources</a> that can be adapted for a particular country.</p>

                assessment. It will incorporate the evidence review of the policy (<i>see</i> <b>Guide
                    2.1</b>) when the options are assessed at stage 4. An assessment of the options could
                also include undertaking stakeholder input or a public consultation (<i>see</i> <b>Guide
                    2.3</b>). Ultimately it will lead to a recommendation of a preferred option for the
                government decision makers.</p>

            <p><b>Ireland produced a regulatory impact assessment</b> that looked at the costs and benefits
                of the policy. It concluded that:</p>
            <p>“The implementation of this measure together with the other measures outlined in Tobacco
                Free Ireland would have the benefit of reducing smoking prevalence in Ireland and
                thereby reducing deaths associated with smoking related diseases. This in turn would
                reduce the costs to the state related to smoking related diseases. A very conservative
                estimate of the costs of illness attributable to smoking was in the region of €664
                million in 2009. The cost of premature mortality in Ireland due to smoking in the same
                year was estimated at €3.5 billion.”<br><a

            </p>
            <p>France did not produce an impact assessment and this omission was used as an argument to
                challenge its legality under the French constitution, although the argument was dismissed.
            </p>
            <p><b>New Zealand produced a similar impact assessment</b> to Ireland's. It concluded that:</p>
            <p>“The status quo does not address the continuing ability of the tobacco industry to use
                packaging in a way that allows advertising and promotion of tobacco products, despite
                the ban on tobacco advertising (and other controls). Similarly, though to increase
                health warning coverage on tobacco packets would reduce the amount of space left on the
                packet for industry promotions, it does not fully address this gap… Accordingly, this
                regulatory impact statement recommends that option 3, Regulatory change to require plain
                packaging of tobacco product.”<br><a

            <p>The UK produced an economic impact assessment, which fully monetized the impact of the
                policy on the UK economy as a whole and concluded that it would lead to a potential <b>£30billion
                    benefit over ten years compared to a £5billion cost</b> (most of the costs were loss of
                tax revenues from the reduction in tobacco consumption). The sort of detailed
                calculations undertaken by the UK were required by internal government rules and can be attacked by the
                tobacco industry as they rely on
                assumptions to make future predictions about economic impacts. Even where one is produced, an
                impact assessment should not be relied on
                as the principle reason for proceeding, but rather one element of the decision-making
                process. In legal challenges in the UK, the tobacco industry focused on what it said were
                flaws in the economic impact assessment (although ultimately the court did not agree with
                the tobacco companies).<br><a
