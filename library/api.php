                                inclusive approach to the aims they wish to achieve and the means by which they should

                                    packets but still allow advertising or promotion of tobacco products in other ways.

                                <li>One of the key aims of plain packaging is that it increases the noticeability and
                                    effectiveness of the Graphic Health Warnings, therefore a country should either have
                                    in place, or be introducing concurrently with plain packaging, health warnings that
                                    are in line with the recommendations of WHO F C T C Article 11 guidelines – at least
                                    50% front and back with graphic pictures.

                                <li>International legal challenges, as well as many national legal jurisdictions, often
                                    include a test of whether it is necessary or justified to introduce a measure that
                                    has the potential to restrict trade in goods or commercial activity. This type of
                                    legal argument includes consideration of whether there are less restrictive
                                    alternative measures that could also meet the policy objectives. If a comprehensive
                                    TAPS ban is not in place or being introduced, a court could consider that a TAPS ban
                                    may be a less restrictive option for achieving the policy objectives than
                                    introducing plain packaging.
                                </li>
                                <li>Tobacco companies could argue that that the efficacy of the policy would be
                                    undermined by other forms of advertising.
                                </li>
                                <li>There is significant research evidence that shows plain packaging is effective at
                                    increasing the noticeability of health warnings. But without regulations requiring
                                    effective health warnings that are in accordance with F C T C recommendations, it
                                    would be difficult to use that to support the defence of plain packaging in a legal
                                    challenge.

                            <p>The tobacco companies regularly say different things in different contexts. Highlighting
                                this can be an effective means of countering their arguments. For instance, in the
                                industry challenge to the UK regulations, the tobacco companies sought to argue that
                                branding on packaging is not the same as advertising and has a different function.
                                However, in the challenge before the High Court of Australia, the tobacco companies made
                                a direct comparison between the space on the packets for branding and advertising
                                billboards (<i>see the</i> <a

                            <p>Another example of this relates to illicit trade. Philip Morris International claimed
                                that branded packaging is difficult or impossible to counterfeit when arguing against
                                plain packaging but at the same time confirmed that branded packaging is easy to
                                counterfeit in a 2012 brochure on Codentify (a track and trace system developed by PMI).
                                A report by KPMG into illicit tobacco in Australia commissioned by Philip Morris Limited
                                confirms that there have been no counterfeit plain packs identified since
                                implementation. The KPMG report is the only statistical evidence the industry uses to
                                support its contention that plain packaging increases illicit trade but the methodology
                                is so flawed that the industry did not use it (or any other evidence) to support that
                                argument in its legal challenge to UK plain packaging regulations.</p>

                                for the opposing arguments. For instance when plain packaging was proposed in Australia,
                                a front group was established, which claimed only to represent the retail industry.
                                However, internal documentation about this group and other industry counter measures

                                Over the course of 20-30 years there have been many peer reviewed scientific research
                                studies looking at the likely impact plain packaging of tobacco would have on smoking
                                behaviours and attitudes and how that would impact on smoking rates. Research has been
                                conducted in 10 different countries using a range of methodologies and each study taken
                                in isolation only provides part of the picture.

                                Countries that have already adopted plain packaging have commissioned independent
                                reviews of the research to ensure that there is a clear, complete and balanced picture
                                of what the overall evidence is on the impact plain packaging will have. By the time of
                                the Hammond review in 2014, a total of 69 original empirical research studies were
                                reviewed (as of October 2016 that number had increased to over 75 relevant studies). The
                                4 reviews show that the evidence on plain packaging is notable for its breadth and
                                diversity of methods but also for its consistency in the results. The evidence reviews
                                were:

                                    <p>It is useful to consider tobacco packaging within the broader context of
                                        branding, marketing and packaging of products more generally.</p>
                                    <p><b>Marketing theory</b> demonstrates that packaging has a number of functions
                                        including assisting consumers to identify and distinguish brands but that it is
                                        also used to promote the product as an important component of overall marketing
                                        strategy. Packaging can heighten a product’s appeal and create positive
                                        impressions and emotional connections to help ‘drive the sale’.</p>
                                    <p><b>Packaging of tobacco products</b> has been shown to be more important as a
                                        promotional tool than for other products. Firstly, in many countries where there
                                        are TAPS bans it is the last remaining means of advertising a brand. Secondly,
                                        tobacco product packs are a ‘badge product’ because users regularly openly
                                        display their packs in public.</p>

                                        manufacturers, and is particularly important for consumer products such as
                                        cigarettes, which have a high degree of social visibility. Unlike many other
                                        consumer products, cigarette packages are displayed each time the product is
                                        used and are often left in public view between uses. As a result, both smokers
                                        and non-smokers report high levels of exposure to tobacco packaging…”</p>

                                    <p>It is important for a full and complete policy development process to properly
                                        consider the views and arguments of the tobacco industry, proxy organisations or
                                        other interested stakeholders. This should include the industry’s analysis of
                                        the evidence relating to the impact on smoking rates in Australia
                                        post-implementation. In addition, the wider impacts should be carefully
                                        considered, in particular the potential or alleged links to down trading and
                                        illicit trade. This can lead to better a policy development but importantly it
                                        protects a government from accusations of an unfair process.</p>
                                    <p>This process should take into account the vested interests of those views and

                                        have been the subject of both academic12 and judicial criticism. The judge in

                            <p>In addition to the solid global evidence base supporting the adoption of plain packaging,
                                it is a policy recommended by the implementation guidelines to the evidence based WH O F
                                C T C . This provides effective grounding for a government decision to proceed with the
                                policy, without the necessity of commissioning new local research or studies into its
                                likely impact in a particular country. From a legal perspective, this position has been
                                confirmed in the ruling by the international investment tribunal in <b>PMI v Uruguay</b>
                                <sup>15</sup>.</p>
                            <p>However, governments should not be dissuaded from commissioning or conducting studies or
                                research into the policy in their country. Additional evidence will be useful for any
                                government seeking to defend the policy against tobacco industry attacks. In addition,
                                there may be circumstances particular to a country that would warrant new research. For
                                instance, in Uruguay there is a brand of cigarettes that has packaging using a colour
                                very similar to the green/brown colour used for tobacco product plain packaging in
                                Australia, UK, France, Ireland and Hungary. Positive associations may have already
                                developed in relation to that colour by some consumers. Some country specific research
                                into the most appropriate colour to use could be of use in such circumstances.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of a regulatory impact analysis is to provide a detailed and systematic appraisal
                            of the potential positive and negative impacts of a new law or regulation in order to assess
                            whether it is likely to achieve the desired objectives and what the potential unintended
                            consequences may be.</p>
                        <p>This analysis is not always a necessary requirement and may be unusual for some governments
                            for a public health measure. However, an assessment of the predicted economic, social and
                            public health impacts can assist with the arguments for proceeding with plain packaging that
                            need to be made in government and with the public.</p>
                        <p>In both domestic and international courts, the tobacco industry regularly alleges that
                            tobacco control laws, especially plain packaging, are arbitrary, not supported by evidence
                            and not adopted with proper due process. A regulatory impact analysis can act as an internal
                            record of the government’s effective policy development and can help to protect the policy
                            against legal challenges.</p>
                        <p>In some countries, for instance the UK, an impact assessment is a government requirement for
                            any policy that has an impact on business, with specified procedures for how one must be
                            produced. In other countries, such as Kenya, there is specific legislation that stipulates
                            when a regulatory impact assessment must be carried out and what it must
                            contain.<sup>1</sup></p>

                        <p><i>“The implementation of this measure together with the other measures outlined in Tobacco
                                Free Ireland would have the benefit of reducing smoking prevalence in Ireland and
                                thereby reducing deaths associated with smoking related diseases. This in turn would
                                reduce the costs to the state related to smoking related diseases. A very conservative
                                estimate of the costs of illness attributable to smoking was in the region of €664
                                million in 2009. The cost of premature mortality in Ireland due to smoking in the same
                                year was estimated at €3.5 billion.”</i><br><a

                        <p><b>New Zealand produced a similar impact assessment</b> to Ireland. It concludes that:</p>
                        <p><i>“The status quo does not address the continuing ability of the tobacco industry to use
                                packaging in a way that allows advertising and promotion of tobacco products, despite
                                the ban on tobacco advertising (and other controls). Similarly, though to increase
                                health warning coverage on tobacco packets would reduce the amount of space left on the
                                packet for industry promotions, it does not fully address this gap… Accordingly, this

                        <p><b>The UK produced an economic impact</b> assessment which fully monetised the impact of the
                            policy on the UK economy as a whole and concluded that it would lead to a potential <b>£30billion
                                benefit over 10 years compared to a £5billion cost</b> (most of the costs were loss of
                            tax revenues from the reduction in tobacco consumption). But the sort of detailed
                            calculations undertaken by the UK can be attacked by the tobacco industry as they rely on
                            assumption and so even where one is produced, an impact assessment should not be relied on
                            as the principle reason for proceeding, but rather one element of the decision making
                            process. In legal challenges in the UK, the tobacco industry focussed on what it said were
                            flaws in the economic impact assessment (although ultimately the court did not agree with
                            the tobacco companies).<br><a

                        <p>Most countries (but not all) that have adopted plain packaging laws, did so after a process
                            that allowed stakeholder input.</p>
                        <p>The process for stake holder input should be guided by the normal administrative procedures
                            in each country. One option is to have full public consultation; alternatively the process
                            may, for instance, form part of parliamentary committee procedures allowing key stakeholders
                            to make written submissions or by way of public hearings which can be a shorter procedure.
                            In Ireland the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill was referred to the
                            parliamentary Joint Committee on Health, which ran public hearings for key stakeholders.</p>
                        <p>It may be unusual for the Health Ministry in some countries to run public consultations in
                            respect of public health measures. Governments do not need to undertake a process for plain
                            packaging that is outside of its normal constitutional requirements. It is also important to
                            bear in mind that a poorly run public consultation which does not allow effective responses
                            or which is a mere sham because the government has already made up its mind, can lead to
                            greater legal problems than not running one at all.</p>

                            industry. Given that plain packaging involves technical regulations that impact on the way
                            in which a product is manufactured, it can be important that those parts of industry that
                            are impacted be allowed to have their input considered. They key to interaction with the

                        <p>Tobacco companies can provide written submissions, which should then made publicly available.

                            advocacy groups on the other. This led to 650,000 responses to the first UK consultation –
                            more than any previous public consultation. If resources are not available to consider huge
                            numbers of responses an alternative method of allowing key stakeholders to provide their
                            submissions should be used which invites the key interested bodies or organisations to make
                            submissions. A consultation is not a vote but a means of ensuring all relevant issues and
                            views are considered.</p>
                        <p>A decision must be taken as to the best stage to have stakeholder input and this will depend
                            on local circumstances. One option is to consult or take submissions on the principle of
                            whether or not to proceed with the plain packaging, but it may be preferable to consult not
                            on whether to proceed but on on the detail of proposal.</p>

                                a consultation run for a minimum of 6 weeks and that the time to review and consider the
                                responses be at least 4 weeks, although this is very dependent on how many responses are
                                received.

                                    policy is discriminatory and in violation of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules
                                    (<i>see</i> <b>GUIDE 4.3 WTO NOTIFICATIONS</b>). Australia and Ireland’s legislation
                                    applies to all tobacco products. However, UK, Norway, France and Hungary apply the
                                    legislation to just cigarettes and hand rolled tobacco. Decisions in those countries
                                    were made because of the limited prevalence of less common tobacco products such as
                                    cigars or pipe tobacco, especially among younger people.</p>

                                    Australia an alpha numeric code is permitted that cannot amount to branding.
                                    Australia also stipulates the size and shape of the sticks because ‘slim sticks’ can
                                    create the impression that they are less harmful. In UK and Ireland, the brand name
                                    and variant is permitted in a specified typeface and location on the stick. It is
                                    recommended that sticks be regulated because failure to do so could lead to more
                                    branding and the use of attractive colours on the cigarette sticks themselves. If

                            that will or could be seen by consumers; rather than ‘in trade’ packaging that is only used
                            in warehouses or wholesalers.</p>
                        <p>There are good legal reasons for this limitation. Plain packaging is a measure designed to
                            merely control the use of tobacco trademarks rather than to completely prohibit the
                            trademarks in all circumstances. Applying the measure only to packing that consumers may see
                            will assist in defending some of the legal claims the tobacco industry may make against the

                            packaging to comply with the new law. This weakens any industry argument that it has
                            suffered loss as a consequence of holding unsold stock. Australia allowed a 3 month sell
                            through period for plain packaging, after which old packs could no longer be sold; the UK
                            allowed a full year.</p>
                        <p>The question of what is a sufficient period of time may differ from country to country.
                            Officials should consider what periods have been allowed for previous packaging
                            requirements, such as changes to health warnings.</p>

                            out most of the detailed requirements. This will depend on the style of legislative drafting
                            and law-making practices for each country as well as the political situation. A shorter Act,
                            or a short provision that is part of a wider tobacco control Act, which just provides simple
                            powers may be easier to get through parliament and less subject to political interference.
                            On the other hand, if there is doubt as to whether the Minister will move quickly to bring
                            in regulations, technical orders or decrees, then it may be better to include the detail in
                            the Act and set a legislative timetable for implementation.</p>
                        <p>If simple powers are taken it is important they are drafted so as to give authority to

                        <p>Every aspect of the packaging presents the tobacco industry with a potential opportunity to
                            introduce novel or different elements which could differentiate and promote the product and
                            undermine the intention to create truly standard packs. Experience shows that tobacco
                            companies will seek to exploit whatever avenue is left to them to differentiate their

                            The guiding principle behind plain packaging is that the only means of differentiation is
                            through the brand and variant name, which are presented in a standard typeface. Achieving
                            this requires regulating each aspect of the packaging and the appearance of individual
                            products, such as cigarette sticks, including:</p>

                        <p>The legislation in force in Australia, the UK, Ireland, France and Hungary (and at the time
                            of writing the proposed laws in New Zealand, Slovenia and Norway) are, in their effect, all
                            very similar (although there are some differences which are highlighted in this
                            toolkit).</p>
                        <p>There have been a number of positive legal rulings on challenges to plain packaging laws in
                            Australia, the EU and the UK, and a ruling is expected in early 2017 on a WTO dispute (<i>see</i>

                                        class="fc-blue-green-2">Guide 4.3</b></a>). Some of the evidence supporting the
                            policy is based around the specific policy decisions that were first developed in Australia.
                            Deviating from those key evidence based policy decisions could risk providing tobacco
                            companies with sufficient grounds to mount legal challenges.</p>
                        <p>Countries considering plain packaging should therefore be cautious of introducing legislation
                            that differs significantly from the plain packaging laws already in force. Emulating
                            existing laws will allow the government to rely on both the evidence base and the positive
                            legal rulings from around the world.</p>

                        <p>It is prudent to adopt legislation that allows for subsequent changes through delegated
                            regulatory powers to the appropriate ministry. Unanticipated issues may arise and the
                            tobacco industry will inevitably try to find ways to undermine the policy.</p>

                            research already conducted that demonstrates the colour to be effective. A ‘matt finish’ to
                            the surface should also be specified to avoid some packs appearing with a glossy finish.</p>

                                    detail and to follow existing legislation. Many of the policy decisions in

                                    cardboard with 20 cigarettes in it, which uses a flip top lid. Because this is the
                                    most common form of packaging for cigarettes, tobacco companies will not have to
                                    make any major adjustments to their machinery to produce this packaging and
                                    therefore it is a least restrictive approach which should be followed unless a
                                    different type or style of packet is more common in the particular country

                        </div>
                        <p><b>There are important legal reasons to ensure that tobacco companies can maintain their
                                trademark registrations even if the use of those trademarks is severely restricted by
                                plain packaging.</b> There are international, regional and national laws which oblige
                            states to maintain trademark registrations. For instance Article 15 of the WTO Trade Related
                            aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) obliges member states to permit
                            registration of signs as trademarks so long as they are capable of distinguishing the goods
                            of one undertaking from those of another.</p>
                        <p>In most jurisdictions non-use of a trademark in practice can lead to applications for
                            de-registration of that trademark, typically after 5 years where there is no good reason for
                            the non-use.</p>
                        <p>If a country’s plain packaging laws mean that tobacco trademarks are fully prohibited or the
                            trademark registration will necessarily be liable to cancellation this may breach
                            international obligations. In addition, plain packaging is better viewed as a control on the
                            use of trademarks rather than a deprivation or expropriation of trademarks.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, most plain packaging legislation (for instance in Australia, UK and Ireland1) has
                            a trademark registration saving provision which states that the legislation does not amount
                            to a prohibition on the use of the trademarks in all circumstances, and that non-use of a
                            trademark as a result of the legislation amounts to a good reason for non-use.</p>
                        <p>The way in which plain packaging might otherwise intersect with a country’s domestic
                            trademark laws needs to be considered carefully.</p>
                        <p>An example of a trademark registration saving provision is in the <b>DRAFT MODEL BILL</b> at
                            Article 13.</p>

                        <p>It is important that coordination occurs across departments to ensure that there is an agreed
                            approach, that the other Ministries understand the need for the policy and are not
                            influenced by the industry’s contrived arguments opposing it. It is useful to have agreed
                            lines on each of the key issues that will be alleged by the industry so that mixed messages
                            are not put out by different parts of government.</p>
                        <p>One possible approach is to form a cross government working group. Another is to ensure all
                            correspondence to any government department about plain packaging are directed to the
                            Ministry of Health for a response. Establishing a whole of government approach to the
                            policy, where possible, can be important for its success and early engagement with the other
                            Ministries can be key. For instance, in the UK the Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
                            produced a full analysis of the likely impact of plain packaging on the illicit market. This
                            analysis identified no evidence or reasons that plain packaging would increase the overall
                            burden of illicit tobacco1, which was highly useful in combatting industry arguments can be
                            key, depending on the political situation in a particular country.</p>

                        <p>It can sometimes assist to have external experts on these issues address officials from the
                            other Ministries. For instance, one of the arguments that is put forward most strongly by
                            the tobacco industry is that plain packaging will increase illicit trade. This argument can
                            be very effective in causing concern within other government departments or with Members of
                            Parliament. However, it is a contrived argument used by the industry to oppose many tobacco
                            control measures and the evidence to support the argument in relation to plain packaging is
                            extremely weak. There are a number of academic researchers who are able to effectively and
                            convincingly demonstrate how the industry is wrong in its allegations about illicit trade.
                            If a Ministry of Health considers that an external expert could assist in the policy
                            development or governmental/parliamentary processes, CTFK may be able help with identifying
                            appropriate persons and organising their visit.</p>
                        <p>In addition, government officials from countries that have already implemented plain
                            packaging are often willing assist to provide information about their policy development and
                            there are many instances of official government visits taking place in relation to the
                            proposed policy. It is highly recommended that Ministry of Health officials make contact
                            with counterparts in those countries that have already adopted plain packaging laws.</p>

                        <p>These rulings express legal principles and decisions that will be of value to lawyers in
                            other jurisdictions that may have to defend plain packaging in their own countries. The
                            judgments also contain clear and concise passages that will help policy makers and civil
                            society organizations to provide information about the policy or promote its implementation.
                            These are explored in more detail in the <a

                            <li>Plain packaging requirements “are no different in kind from any legislation that
                                requires labels that warn against the use or misuse of a product.” <sup>1</sup></li>
                            <li>“[The tobacco companies’] body of expert evidence does not accord with internationally
                                recognised best practice.” <sup>2</sup></li>
                            <li>“In my judgment the qualitative evidence relied upon by the [Government] is cogent,
                                substantial and overwhelmingly one-directional in its conclusion” <sup>3</sup></li>
                            <li>“[WTO] TRIPS and the FCTC can be read together without any risk of them colliding or
                                being mutually inconsistent” <sup>4</sup></li>
                            <li>Trademarks provide “a right of use that exists vis-à-vis other persons, an exclusive
                                right, but a relative one. It is not an absolute right to use that can be asserted
                                against the State.” <sup>6</sup></li>
                            <li>“Manufacturers and distributors of harmful products such as cigarettes can have no
                                expectation that new and more onerous regulations will not be imposed” <sup>5</sup></li>

                            plain packaging of tobacco products breaches any of the WTO agreements.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the TBT Agreement is to avoid unnecessary regulatory obstacles to
                            international trade while <b>allowing for the regulatory autonomy of states to protect
                                legitimate public interests such as public health.</b> Article 2.9 obliges WTO member to
                            notify drafts of technical regulations that could impact on international trade and which
                            are not international standards, so that other WTO members can consider the regulations and
                            make comments.</p>
                        <p>A technical regulation is defined as being a regulation that: <i>“lays down product
                                characteristics or their related processes and production methods. Compliance is
                                mandatory. They may also deal with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking and
                                labelling requirements.”</i></p>
                        <p><b>Plain packaging falls within the definition of a technical regulation</b> that relates to
                            the trade in goods and is one that has not as yet been established as an international
                            standard.</p>

                        <p>This means that it should be at a stage which sets out the detail of what the government
                            intends to adopt but is still capable of amendment. The W T O T B T procedure then requires
                            <b>a 60 day stand still period</b> during which the legislative adoption process is frozen
                            so that written comments from other WTO members can be sent on the draft measure. <b>This
                                period must be factored into the legislative timetable.</b></p>
                        <p>There is also a requirement under Article 2.9 that the final adopted measure be published and
                            it is recommended that there is a 6 month period between publication and coming into

                        <p>Many of these notifications received comments from other member countries in T B T committee
                            meetings. Some countries, including those that brought a WTO dispute procedure against
                            Australia (such as Indonesia, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Honduras) and some tobacco
                            producing countries (such as Malawi, Zimbabwe and Nicaragua), have given negative comments
                            to the committees; but many countries including New Zealand, Norway, Canada, Uruguay and the
                            EU also provided positive comments supporting the position that plain packaging does not
                            breach the WTO agreements and is a legitimate public health measure. In a number of
                            committee meetings where Member State’s proposals for plain packaging were discussed, a
                            representative of the World Health Organisation provided support for the measure and
                            stressed that there is a strong body of evidence to support the position that plain
                            packaging will achieve its objectives<sup>1</sup>.</p>
                        <p>None of these comments in committee have led to further dispute procedures being commenced
                            against any country that has adopted plain packaging laws, other than Australia.</p>

                        <p>At the time of writing, a WTO dispute settlement panel is adjudicating complaints by Cuba,
                            the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Indonesia with respect to Australia’s plain packaging
                            laws. It has been widely reported that British American Tobacco and Philip Morris are
                            providing funding and legal support for Honduras and Dominican Republic in the
                            proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The panel’s decision is expected not before May 2017.</p>
                        <p>There are well established principles and rules that demonstrate the flexibility for WTO
                            Members to regulate for public health. These are described in the WHO publication on plain
                            packaging of tobacco products2 and are set out briefly in in <a

                            Materials. The main issues of dispute fall under Article 2.2 of the T B T Agreement and
                            Article 20 of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS).</p>
                        <p>The WTO panel decision may be the subject of an appeal by the Parties but in the meantime it
                            appears unlikely that any further dispute will arise concerning plain packaging laws of
                            other WTO Members until that dispute is fully resolved.</p>

                            The European Union Tobacco Products Directive (EU TPD) includes some provisions concerning
                            the packaging and presentation of tobacco products and so requires a ‘partial’
                            standardisation of packaging policy (for instance, the shape and opening of cigarette
                            packets as well as the minimum content). These obligations must be implemented by all EU
                            Member States, including the UK, Ireland, France and Hungary. Where a reference is made to
                            one of these EU TPD requirements, it will necessarily be part of the domestic legislation in
                            each of those countries.

                        <p>It is important to specify very precisely the <i>exact</i> color required for the packaging,
                            otherwise variations of color will appear, defeating the intention of standardizing
                            packaging. Simply requiring brown, or a green/brown, is insufficient.</p>
                        <p>Pantone provides a system of accurate color categorisation. There are no copyright issues in
                            using these colors in legislation (this was confirmed with Pantone in the UK and Australia).
                            The Pantone system has terms of categorisation and identification and the colors are not
                            trademarked.</p>
                        <p>What color should the packs be? Australia commissioned research into which color was
                            perceived to be the least appealing for tobacco packaging. The research looked at a range of
                            issues, including consumer perceptions of branding appeal and smoking harm, consumer
                            perceptions of plain pack colors, and legibility of brand names on plain packs. The research
                            found a dark brown color to be the best candidate, as people perceived it to be the least
                            appealing and thought that the packs would contain cigarettes that are more harmful to
                            health and harder to quit.</p>

                            recommended that these colors are used in all plain packaging legislation because of the
                            research already conducted that demonstrates the efficacy of this colour. There could be
                            legal risks in deviating from that evidence base.</p>
                        <p>A ‘matt finish’ to the surface should also be specified to avoid some packs appearing with a

                        <p>The color of the inside or internal surfaces of packs also need to be defined. In most

                            needed for any text that appears on the packets (other than any health warnings and messages
                            that are already mandated - for most countries these will already be required in existing

                        </p>
                        <p>It is sensible to include a provision in the legislation which states that the plain
                            packaging law does not prevent any text symbol or other mark that is required by other
                            legislation. It is not recommended that legislation permits a recycling or no littering
                            symbol as these can provide positive social associations for tobacco manufacturers. </p>

                                are examples of a single packet being in a further outer packet).
                            </li>
                            <li>iii. Where there are requirements for different surfaces (for instance the brand name

                                to whether and how to define those surfaces.
                            </li>

                        <p>The existing legislation of countries that have adopted plain packaging approach these issues
                            in different ways. An example is given in the Model Law included with this Toolkit.</p>

                        <div class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-2">5. Shape and type of packets</div>
                        <p>When standardising the shape and type of packaging it is recommended that the legislation
                            requires the most common type of packaging that already existing on the market. The most
                            common type of cigarette pack around the world is a rectangular (or cuboid) box of 20
                            cigarettes with a flip top lid.</p>
                        <p>However, governments considering plain packaging should look at what packaging already exists
                            and is common on the market in their country. Some pack shapes may have positive
                            associations for consumers, such as with the slim packs discussed above, so there may be
                            good reasons to prohibit them. However, without good reason, prohibiting the most commonly
                            used type of packaging for a particular category of product could be grounds for legal
                            challenge as being unnecessarily restrictive or leading to unnecessary costs for the tobacco
                            manufacturers by forcing a change to their manufacturing processes. This is one reason why
                            it is recommended that MoH officials conduct a market survey of the packaging that exists on
                            the market in their country (see <b>Guide 2.1: Evidence Review</b>).</p>

                        <div class="section-tertiary-title fc-ref-mat-2"><u>Cigarettes:</u></div>
                        <p>In Australia, packs must conform to <b>specific dimensions</b> with <b>rectangular surfaces
                                that have straight sides and right angles<sup>2</sup></b>, and so pack shape is defined
                            in that way. This means that all individual packs must be virtually identical in shape and
                            size. Beveled edges are prohibited. This legislation therefore requires what is, for many
                            countries, the most common shape, size and opening of cigarette packs.</p>
                        <p>For EU states, under the EU TPD, packs must be <b>cuboid<sup>3</sup></b> but there is no
                            specified dimension (although the full health warning must be fitted on the appropriate
                            surfaces which means that ‘slim packs’ are not allowed – see part 7 below). This means there
                            is some scope for tobacco companies to vary the dimensions of the cuboid shape and soft
                            packs are permitted.</p>
                        <p>Just requiring a cuboid like the EU is a simpler means of specifying the shape but specifying
                            dimensions and prohibiting bevelled or rounded edges as Australia has done is
                            recommended.</p>

                        <p>In the EU,cigarettes in a pack that can be resealed or reclosed must have either flip-top lid
                            hinged at the back, or a shoulder box hinged lid — “clam shell” — hinged at the back
                            <sup>5</sup>. This also permits soft packs that involve tearing open the paper seal and
                            cannot be reclosed once opened. All these packs are common in some EU countries.</p>

                            sliding a panel on the front of the pack with your thumb to make the very top of the pack
                            flip open) can fall within the definition of a flip-top lid. As the diagram below shows, the
                            Glide Tec opening is at the top and it flips open. Without a specific definition in
                            legislation it is arguable that different types of opening such as Glide Tec could fall
                            within the term. Drafters should therefore consider whether to either define flip-top lid
                            (which can be difficult) or use a diagram within the legislation, such as the one shown
                            above and included in the <b>TEMPLATE MODEL LAW.</b></p>

                        <p>It is important to regulate the size of tobacco packages. This is to prevent slim packs that

                        <br>
                        <p>These slim packs usually have slim cigarettes contained in them.</p>
                        <p>Australia sets minimum and maximum dimensions for individual packets and also has minimum and
                            maximum dimensions for the cigarette stick.</p>
                        <p>Under the EU Tobacco Products Directive, the graphic health warnings on cigarette packs must
                            conform to minimum dimensions as well as being 65% of the front and back surfaces, which
                            means that small cigarette packets are not permitted because they could not fit the
                            full-size health warnings on them. Because of this, EU countries have so far not set minimum
                            dimensions for pack sizes.</p>
                        <p>A decision to fully future proof the policy would mean following the Australian example, as
                            this better protects against variations in the sizes of cigarette packs. This is the
                            approach taken in the Template Model Law.</p>

                        <p>While using a novel or different material to make packaging might be expensive for
                            manufacturers, it is not inconceivable that this would be used to differentiate a particular
                            product. It is therefore important to specify what material must be used to make the
                            cigarette packs.</p>
                        <p>There is already some variation in the packaging material used for other types of product,
                            such as loose tobacco or cigars. For instance, loose tobacco can comes in tins, pouches, or
                            boxes. Thus far, states adopting plain packaging have not put as many restrictions on the
                            nature of the packaging for other tobacco products, but each government considering the
                            policy should review the products on the market in that country and consider if it is
                            appropriate to specify the material (as well as shape and size) of packs for products other
                            than cigarettes.</p>
                        <p>Australia requires that cigarette packs must be rigid and made of only cardboard<sup>8</sup>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The EU TPD requires cigarette packs to be made of “carton or <i>soft</i>
                            material,”<sup>9</sup> which does provide for some scope for variation. Only time will show
                            ifany significant variations in packaging material are developed in EU countries that adopt
                            plain packaging. </p>
                        <p>It is recommended that countries follow the approach of Australia unless there are local
                            reasons to take a different approach. The Template Model Law is drafted to require rigid
                            cigarette packs made only of cardboard.</p>

                        <p>The packaging processes for cigarettes use linings to fit the cigarettes into the packets.
                            These linings are typically made of a silver foil with a white paper backing. The foil has
                            small embossed marks on them that are necessary to provide the friction used to insert the
                            cigarettes into the packets. For this reason, these linings are permitted in the legislation
                            of those states that have adopted plain packaging, so long as they are only for the <i>“automated
                                manufacturing process”</i> and only if the linings conform to the specified requirements<sup>10</sup>
                            and do not have any branding on them.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that similar provisions are used in any plain packaging law to avoid
                            tobacco manufacturers arguing that the laws required unnecessary and expensive changes to
                            their packaging processes.</p>

                            manufacturing process.” In Australia, some products have been manufactured where the
                            “lining” can act as a separate container so that the cigarettes can be removed from the

                            the Template Model Law at Article 7(2).</p>

                            Unfortunately it appears this does not breach the UK law as drafted (although it should be

                            text of the <b>Template Model Law</b> is used because that draft text requires that all
                            packaging must be rigid cardboard or, if it is the lining, a single sheet of paper backed
                            silver foil.

                            without specific drafting in the law, the wrapperscould fall within the definition of <i>external

                            in Australia, the UK, and Ireland<sup>24</sup>) has a trademark-registration-saving
                            provision that states that the legislation does not amount to a prohibition on the use of
                            the trademarks in all circumstances, and that non-use of a trademark as a result of the

                                    provisions relating to liability and enforcement. For example, on the question of
                                    who is legally responsible for compliance with packaging and labeling measures, the
                                    Guidelines at paragraph 55 state: <i> “Parties should specify that tobacco product

                                <p>In the UK, for instance, a person who manufactures or imports a tobacco product that
                                    is intended for sale in the UK, or sells a tobacco product in the UK (either in
                                    trade or to a consumer) that has retail packaging that does not comply with the
                                    Regulations is liable for a range of criminal penalties from a fine of up to £5000
                                    to a jail sentence of up to two years. The UK law also stipulates that, if an
                                    offense is committed by a body corporate (a corporation or company), then the
                                    officers of the company, such as the managing director, may be
                                    prosecuted.<sup>25</sup> The prospect of a jail sentence for the company management

                                plain packaging. </p>
                            <p>Over the course of 20-30 years there have been many <b>peer reviewed scientific research
                                    studies</b> looking at the
                                impact
                                that plain packaging of tobacco would have on smoking behaviours and attitudes and the
                                likely consequential impact
                                on smoking rates.</p>
                            <p>Research has been conducted in more than 10 different countries using a range of
                                methodologies and each study taken
                                in isolation only provides part of the picture. </p>

                            <p><u>The different types of research studies include</u>:</p>
                            <p>Behavioural studies aimed to test whether participants believed that plain packaging
                                would change their purchasing
                                behaviour. </p>
                            <p>Surveys of consumer groups to consider the appeal of plain packs compared with branded
                                packs.</p>
                            <p>Studies using mock-ups of standardised packaging to see how smokers and potential smokers
                                react to them.</p>
                            <p>Eye tracking studies that looked at whether people focused more on the health warnings
                                when branding was
                                removed. </p>
                            <p>Qualitative and survey research looking at the impact of removing branding on smoker
                                image and product
                                associations. </p>
                            <p>Studies into whether and how perceptions of the harmfulness and strength of standardised
                                packages differ from
                                branded packs (and how different kinds of plain packages differ in this regard). </p>
                            <p>Studies using a “pack-offer” task to assess the demand for plain packaging. In each of
                                these studies, youth
                                participants were offered a choice of packs.</p>
                            <p>Naturalistic trials of plain packaging where smokers used brown ‘plain’ packs for two
                                weeks and their regular packs
                                for two weeks in “real-life” settings. The studies analysed avoidance behaviours, such
                                as hiding or covering the
                                pack.</p>

                            <p>This research is criticised by the tobacco industry because the studies consider
                                attitudes, beliefs, and predictions
                                of future behaviour but fail, they claim, to demonstrate a link with actual behaviour.
                                They also criticise the
                                methodology of individual studies. But the research is persuasive because of the high
                                degree of consistency across
                                more than 75 studies from numerous countries and using different methodologies. </p>
                            <p>The tobacco industry also criticises the research for failing to include a randomised
                                control trial of plain
                                packaging. But as has been pointed out, it would not be possible or ethical to undertake
                                such a trial. To do so
                                would require studies to be carried out within a suitably large and isolated population
                                free of known confounding
                                factors that influence smoking and prevalence. Such studies would expose a randomised
                                group of children and/ or
                                adults to nicotine exposure and addiction. </p>
                            <p>As is highlighted elsewhere in this toolkit, <b>the tobacco industry is rarely, if ever,
                                    able to rely on peer

                                    studies to support its arguments that plain packaging will not be effective; and the
                                    tobacco companies have
                                    consistently refused to disclose any of their own research or behavioural studies
                                    into the likely effects of
                                    plain

                            <p>A number of studies suggest that plain packaging increases the salience of health
                                warnings, including experimental
                                and survey studies from Australia and Canada <sup>13</sup>, with impacts that go above

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Misleading tobacco packaging</h3>
                            <p><b>Studies have demonstrated there is a strong association between pack design and false
                                    consumer perceptions of
                                    risk. <sup>15</sup> </b></p>
                            <p>Tobacco branding can mislead consumers as to the relative harms of one product compared
                                to other products. Many
                                countries have banned terms such as “light” and “mild” for this reason, as all the
                                evidence shows that these
                                products are equally dangerous. However, smokers and non-smokers continue to hold
                                mistaken beliefs about different
                                tobacco products because of the tobacco companies’ use of colors and branding. Some pack
                                designs preserve the
                                branding used for prohibited brand variants. For instance, Marlboro Lights became
                                Marlboro Gold, and Marlboro Ultra
                                Lights became Marlboro Silver. Similar tactics were used by other companies. The color
                                of packs in particular
                                affects consumers’ perceptions of risk. Lighter packs are perceived as being less harsh
                                and having lower tar levels
                                than darker colors, even when there is identical products in them. <sup>16</sup></p>

                            <p>Peer-reviewed studies from many countries show that plain packaging will minimize the
                                ability of packaging and brand
                                variants to mislead consumers about the relative harms of different products.

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Background</h3>
                            <p>In 2012,the UK Department of Health commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on
                                plain tobacco packaging. The
                                review was supported through the Public Health Research Consortium (PHRC), a network of
                                researchers at the
                                University of Stirling, the University of Nottingham, and the Institute of Education,
                                London.</p>

                            <p>Screening led to 37 studies being analyzed. The resulting report was peer reviewed and
                                published at the same time as
                                the 2012 consultation. It was made clear that the PHRC report represented the work and
                                views of the authors, not
                                necessarily those of the UK Department of Health. An update was published in September
                                2013, which considered
                                seventeen new studies published since the original Stirling Review in 2012.</p>

                            <p>The Stirling Review found that:</p>

                            <p class="p-states">“There is strong evidence to support the propositions. . . that plain

                                warnings and messages and it would reduce the use of design techniques that may mislead
                                consumers about the

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Methodology</h3>

                            <p>The review aimed to examine all available current evidence on the effects of plain
                                packaging in the areas of pack
                                appeal; effectiveness of health warnings; and perceptions of product harm and strength.
                                It employed systematic
                                review methodology and examined studies from 1980 to the date of review.</p>

                            <p>A total of 4,518 citations were identified following initial searching, and, after
                                screening and quality appraisal,
                                37 studies were included in the systematic review. Most of the studies included in the
                                review were conducted in
                                Australasia, North America, or Western Europe.</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Findings</h3>

                            <p>Appeal of cigarettes, packs and brands: </p>
                            <p>All studies reported that plain packs were rated as less attractive than branded
                                equivalent packs by both adults
                                and children. </p>
                            <p>Plain packs were perceived to be poorer quality, poorer tasting, and cheaper than branded
                                equivalent packs.</p>
                            <p>Positive impressions of smoker identity and personality attributes associated with
                                specific brands were weakened or
                                disappeared with plain packaging.</p>
                            <p>Non-smokers and younger people responded more negatively to plain packs than smokers and
                                older people. </p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Effectiveness of health warnings</h3>
                            <p>Overall, the studies suggest that plain packaging tends to increase the recall of health
                                warnings, the attention
                                paid to them, and their perceived seriousness and believability. </p>
                            <p>Findings appear to be moderated by the type, size, and position of health warning
                                used.</p>
                            <p>Only one study examined sub-group differences and reported that non-smokers and weekly
                                smokers may pay more
                                attention to warnings on plain packs than daily smokers. </p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Perceptions of product harm and strength:</h3>
                            <p>Plain packaging can reduce misperceptions about the relative harmfulness of different
                                brands.</p>
                            <p>Colors of packs affect perceptions of product harm and strength. In general, plain packs
                                are perceived as more
                                harmful than branded packs if in a darker color, such as brown, and, conversely, less
                                harmful than branded packs if
                                in lighter colors, such as white. Red packs are perceived to contain stronger cigarettes
                                than light-colored
                                packs.</p>
                            <p>Use of descriptors, such as “gold” or “smooth,” on plain packs have the potential to
                                mislead consumers, as they do
                                on branded packs.</p>
                            <p>In general, smokers are more likely to have misperceptions about the harmfulness of
                                packs, both branded and plain,
                                than non-smokers. </p>

                                although in some studies they

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Conclusions</h3>
                            <p>Plain packaging has been shown to:</p>
                            <p>reduce pack and product appeal by making packs appear less attractive and of lower
                                quality, and by weakening the
                                positive smoker identity and personality attributes associated with branded packs;</p>
                            <p>increase the salience of health warnings in terms of improving the recall and perceived
                                seriousness and
                                believability of warnings; and</p>
                            <p>reduce the confusion about product harm that can result from branded packs. </p>

                            <p>Plain packaging was also perceived as likely to have a deterrent effect on the onset of
                                smoking by young people and
                                as likely to encourage existing smokers to quit. The review also found some evidence
                                that non-smokers and, to a
                                lesser extent, smokers approved of the idea of plain packaging, with both groups feeling
                                it would make smoking less
                                attractive, particularly to young people.</p>

                            <p>Despite some limitations of the review identified by the researchers, they say that it is
                                worth emphasizing the
                                remarkable consistency in study findings regarding the potential impact of plain
                                packaging. Across studies using
                                different designs, conducted in a range of countries, with young and older populations
                                and with smokers and
                                non-smokers the key findings are similar. This consistency of evidence can provide
                                confidence about the observed
                                potential effects of plain packaging.</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Background</h3>
                            <p>In November 2013, the UK Department of Health commissioned Sir Cyril Chantler to
                                undertake an independent review of
                                whether or not the introduction of standardized packaging of tobacco was likely to have
                                an effect on public health,
                                in particular in relation to children.</p>
                            <p>The remit of this review was wider than the Stirling Review and included consideration of
                                evidence on the impact in
                                Australia as well as industry arguments and possible unintended consequences.</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Methodology</h3>
                            <p>The Chantler Review considered all the evidence relevant to whether or not the
                                introduction of standardized packaging
                                would be beneficial to public health. The validity of the Stirling systematic review was
                                also considered. </p>
                            <p>The Chantler Review invited interested parties to submit research-based material, and
                                took evidence during two
                                meetings. Separate meetings were held withthe Smokefree Action Coalition, the Tobacco
                                Manufacturers Association,and
                                representatives of Philip Morris Ltd. Sir Cyril also visited Australia to study its
                                experience of implementing plain
                                packaging.</p>
                            <p>He commissioned further expert advice to assist in the analysis of the key evidence. In

                                Stirling Review (and the
                                subsequent update) using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme assessment tools. These
                                were undertaken by academics at
                                Southampton University and Kings College London, respectively.</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Findings</h3>

                            <p>Sir Cyril Chantler’s overall conclusion was that it is “<b>highly likely that
                                    standardised packaging would serve to
                                    reduce the rate of children taking up smoking and implausible that it would increase
                                    the consumption of tobacco
                                    . . . I am satisfied that the body of evidence shows that standardised packaging, in
                                    conjunction with the
                                    current tobacco control regime, is very likely to lead to a modest but important
                                    reduction over time on the
                                    uptake and prevalence of smoking and thus have a positive impact on public
                                    health</b>.”</p>

                            <p>Tobacco marketing and branding</p>

                            <p class="p-states">“<b>There is very strong evidence that exposure to tobacco advertising
                                    and promotion increases the
                                    likelihood of children taking up smoking. Industry documents show that tobacco
                                    packaging has for decades been
                                    designed, in the light of market research, with regard to what appeals to target
                                    groups</b>. Branded cigarettes
                                are
                                ‘badge’ products, frequently on display, which therefore act as a “silent salesman.”
                                Tobacco packages appear to be
                                especially important as a means of communicating brand imagery in countries like
                                Australia and the UK which have
                                comprehensive bans on advertising and promotion. . .</p>

                            <p class="p-states">The tobacco industry argues that all of its marketing activity,
                                including packaging, aims solely to
                                persuade existing adult smokers to switch brand and never targets children or new
                                smokers. However, in my opinion,
                                whatever their intent, it is not plausible that the effect of branded packaging is only
                                to encourage brand switching
                                amongst adult smokers, and never to encourage non-smokers from taking up smoking. I have
                                heard no coherent argument
                                as to how this purported separation occurs in practice and in my opinion a ‘spillover
                                effect’ is highly plausible
                                whereby packages that are designed to appeal to a young adult, also, albeit
                                inadvertently, appeal to children. <b>It
                                    seems to me that children and non-smokers are not, and cannot be, quarantined from
                                    seeing tobacco packaging and
                                    in
                                    my view once they are exposed to this packaging, they are susceptible to its appeal
                                    whether it is intended to
                                    target
                                    them or not. In the light of these and other considerations set out in my report I
                                    believe that branded
                                    packaging
                                    contributes to increased tobacco consumption</b>.”</p>

                            <p>The evidence</p>
                            <p class="p-states">“There has been, as opponents of standardised packaging have rightly
                                pointed out to me in the course
                                of this Review, no randomised controlled trial carried out to test the impact of
                                standardised packaging on the take
                                up of smoking amongst children.

                                I do not consider it to be possible or ethical to undertake such a trial. To do so would
                                require studies to be
                                carried out within a suitably large and isolated population free of known confounding
                                factors that influence smoking
                                and prevalence. Such studies would expose a randomised group of children to nicotine
                                exposure and possible
                                addiction.

                                <br>
                                <b>I see the importance of Stirling as being the consistency of its results on appeal,
                                    salience and perceptions of
                                    harm, most notably that standardised packaging is less appealing than branded
                                    packaging</b>. This evidence is
                                direct and
                                not reliant on stated intentions. Evidence from other spheres shows a strong
                                non-conscious link between appeal and
                                subsequent behaviour regardless of stated intentions. I therefore conclude that, by
                                reducing its appeal,
                                standardised packaging would affect smoking behaviour.”

                            <p><i>Plain packaging will lead to price reductions:</i></p>

                            <p class="p-states">“First, tobacco companies have argued that standardised packaging will
                                result in falling prices that
                                in turn will increase the consumption of tobacco. They argue that, in the long-run at
                                least, standardised packaging
                                will reduce brand loyalty, causing smokers to switch to cheaper brands and encouraging
                                price competition between
                                manufacturers. However, <b>early evidence from Australia does not show falling prices;
                                    rather price rises have
                                    continued over and above tax increases</b>. There is some evidence of trading down
                                towards cheaper brands, but
                                this
                                appears to be a continuation of an ongoing market trend. Were all this to change, the
                                Government can in any case
                                mitigate any price reduction by increasing tobacco taxes.”</p>

                            <p><i>Plain packaging will lead to price reductions:</i></p>

                            <p class="p-states">“Second, I am not convinced by the tobacco industry’s argument that
                                standardised packaging would
                                increase the illicit market, especially in counterfeit cigarettes. There is <b>no
                                    evidence that standardised
                                    packaging
                                    is easier to counterfeit, and indeed in Australia, hardly any counterfeit

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Background</h3>
                            <p>In March 2014, Professor David Hammond, an associate Professor of health behaviour and
                                health policy at the
                                University of Waterloo, Canada, published an evidence review on standardized packaging,
                                which had been commissioned
                                by the Irish Department of Health. </p>
                            <p>The report is available here:
                                <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/standardised-packaging-d-hammond/">http://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/standardised-packaging-d-hammond/</a>
                            </p>

                            <p>It reviews the scientific evidence on standardized packaging and the extent to which
                                standardized packaging
                                regulations would help Ireland to achieve its tobacco control objectives.</p>

                            <p>Professor Hammond also included an the results of important research into the <b>evidence
                                    from millions of internal
                                    industry documents released through court disclosure</b>, which contribute to the
                                evidence base on tobacco
                                packaging and
                                the industry’s extensive use of packaging as a marketing tool. This part of his report
                                is dealt with in detail on
                                the <b>Tobacco Branding</b> page of the Tools and Resources.</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Methodology</h3>
                            <p class="p-states">“A total of 69 original empirical articles were reviewed as part of this
                                report, in addition to
                                evidence contained in corporate documents from the tobacco industry and the broader
                                literature on tobacco
                                advertising and marketing. The evidence on plain packaging is notable for its breadth
                                and diversity: research has
                                been conducted in 10 different countries using a range of methodologies, including
                                consumer perceptions,
                                eye-tracking technology, neuroimaging, measures of consumer demand, and behavioural
                                tasks, as well as evidence on
                                the impact of plain packaging in Australia. Public opinion articles, reviews and
                                commentaries were excluded from
                                this review.”</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Findings</h3>

                            <p>Professor Hammond summarizes the academic literature with respect to six primary
                                outcomes: health warnings,
                                perceptions of risk, consumer appeal, measures of consumer demand and smoking behavior,
                                post-implementation research
                                from Australia, and research on differences in plain packaging colors. The findings
                                are:</p>

                            <p>Health warnings</p>
                            <p class="p-states">“Overall, the evidence suggests that health warnings are more noticeable
                                on plain packs, associated
                                with greater recall of health messages, and may lead to greater cognitive processing,
                                particularly among youth
                                non-smokers. The evidence also indicates that the effect of package branding persists
                                even in the context of large
                                pictorial warnings, and that plain packaging and health warnings have complimentary, but
                                independent effects on
                                consumer perceptions.”</p>

                            <p>Perceptions of risk</p>
                            <p class="p-states">“Many consumers continue to hold false beliefs that some cigarette
                                brands are less harmful than
                                others, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Pack design and colour promote
                                false beliefs about the relative
                                risks between brands. A variety of experimental studies indicate that plain packaging is
                                associated with fewer false
                                health beliefs.”</p>

                            <p>Consumer appeal</p>
                            <p class="p-states">“The evidence unequivocally demonstrates that plain packaging is
                                perceived as less attractive and
                                less appealing, particularly among youth and young adults, including smokers and
                                non-smokers. Plain packaging is
                                also associated with less positive brand imagery, including smoker traits, such as cool,
                                stylish, thin. The findings
                                suggest that plain packaging is less socially desirable and limits the ability of
                                packaging to target sub-groups of
                                youth and young adults.”</p>

                            <p>Measures of consumer demand and smoking behavior</p>
                            <p class="p-states">“Evidence from a range of methodologies indicates that plain packaging
                                reduces consumer demand.
                                Evidence from a limited number of naturalistic studies suggest that plain packaging may
                                promote smoking cessation
                                among established smokers, although additional studies are required to demonstrate this
                                effect. Findings from
                                clinical studies also indicates that branded tobacco packaging is a reliable cue for
                                smoking and can prompt urges to
                                smoke among former smokers, and that exposure to plain packages reduces urges and
                                motivation to smoke compared to
                                branded packages.”</p>

                            <p>Post-implementation: the impact of plain packaging regulations in Australia</p>
                            <p class="p-states">“Given the novelty of plain packaging regulations in Australia, there
                                are few studies to assess the
                                impact of plain packaging. To date, three published studies provide preliminary evidence
                                suggesting that plain
                                packaging has had a positive public health impact in Australia. Of the three studies,
                                objective data indicating a
                                significant increase in calls to the Quitline — an effective form of smoking
                                cessation149 — are most compelling. No
                                studies have examined the impact of plain packaging within the context of smoking
                                initiation.”</p>

                            <p>Plain pack color</p>
                            <p class="p-states">“Studies are consistent in demonstrating that darker, non-white colours
                                are perceived as
                                significantly less appealing and more effective. Therefore, while the primary objective
                                of standardizing colour
                                would be to have uniform appearance, to minimize the belief that some products are less
                                harmful than others, using a
                                darker colour may reduce the overall appeal of all packages.”</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Conclusions</h3>
                            <p>The report draws some strong conclusions, which are in line with the conclusions of the
                                Chantler Review:</p>

                            <p class="p-states">“Tobacco advertising and marketing are among the most important factors
                                in the rise of smoking in
                                the 20th century. Industry marketing campaigns have sought to communicate three
                                fundamental themes: 1) product
                                satisfaction; 2) reassurance about the health concerns; and 3) positive associations
                                between smoking and desirable
                                outcomes, such as independence, social status, sexual attraction and thinness. Tobacco
                                industry documents and
                                independent evidence indicates that packaging has played a fundamental role in executing
                                each of these themes, and
                                has grown in importance as other forms of advertising and marketing have been
                                prohibited.

                                “The scientific evidence on plain packaging includes more than 70 original empirical
                                articles from a wide variety of
                                research domains. Most of the research on plain packaging is experimental in nature and
                                has been conducted in
                                jurisdictions without plain packaging given that plain packaging regulations were only
                                implemented in December 2012
                                in Australia. The evidence is highly consistent across different research domain and
                                study designs, as well as
                                between experimental and more recent “post-implementation” studies conducted in
                                Australia.
                            </p>

                            <p>“Overall, the existing evidence on plain packaging supports four primary conclusions:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Plain packaging will reduce smoking initiation among youth and young adults.</li>
                                <li>Plain packaging will promote smoking cessation among established smokers.</li>
                                <li>Plain packaging will support former smokers to remain abstinent.</li>
                                <li>Plain packaging will help to denormalize tobacco use”</li>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Methodology</h3>
                            <p>The review searched nine databases for articles evaluating standardised packaging that
                                had been already reviewed by
                                academics and published before January 2016. We also checked references in those papers
                                to other studies and
                                contacted the authors where necessary. The research found 51 studies involving
                                approximately 800,000
                                participants.</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Primary Outcomes</h3>
                            <p>The primary outcome measured by the review was changes in tobacco use prevalence
                                including uptake, cessation and
                                reduction in overall consumption. </p>
                            <p>The review found only 5 studies that addressed these primary outcomes measurements. The
                                reason for this may be that
                                even in Australia, it is at an early stage of implementation to get reliable statistical
                                data on the impacts of
                                plain packaging on overall prevalence. </p>
                            <p>The only study that considered overall prevalence was the analysis by Professor Chipty
                                that is included in
                                Australia’s Post Implementation Review (see the pages on <b>Australia Post

                                and
                                Resources). That analysis of statistical data concluded that a drop of 0.55 percentage
                                points in smoking prevalence
                                was attributable to plain packaging. </p>
                            <p>3 studies on consumption in Australia and the UK found little change in smokers’
                                consumption levels.</p>
                            <p>A national study of adult smoker quit attempts showed an increase from 20% prior to the
                                introduction of plain
                                packaging, compared to 26.6% 1 year after implementation. This was backed up by the fact
                                that calls to quit lines

                            <p>The review anticipated very few studies on the primary outcome at this stage of
                                implementation. The review therefore
                                also reviewed studies on secondary outcomes including:</p>
                            <p>behaviours such as stubbing out cigarettes early, covering the pack, and eye tracking in
                                experimental studies,
                                and</p>
                            <p>non-behavioural studies such as intentions of young people, pack appeal, recall of health
                                warnings and perceptions
                                of harm.</p>

                            <p>These studies found evidence of increased avoidance behaviours, increased attention to
                                health warnings and reduced
                                cravings. Studies also indicated that plain packs were less likely to motivate
                                initiation among youth.</p>

                            <h3 class="fc-ref-mat-4 sub-title">Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>The review concluded that the evidence suggests that standardised packaging may reduce
                                smoking prevalence. The review
                                noted the limitations on the currently available data on prevalence but concludes that a
                                reduction in smoking
                                behavior is supported by routinely collected data by the Australian government. Data on
                                the effects of standardized
                                packaging on non-behavioral outcomes (e.g. pack appeal and recall of health warnings)
                                are clearer and provide
                                plausible mechanisms for the observed decline in prevalence.</p>

                            <p>The review did not find any evidence suggesting standardized packaging may increase
                                tobacco use. <sup>19</sup></p>

                            <p>Further research into likely impacts of tobacco plain packaging has continued to be
                                undertaken around the world since
                                these evidence reviews were published. The following is not intended to be a
                                comprehensive review of this additional

                                    impact of plain packaging in
                                    low- and middle-income countries and in low-income settings in high-income
                                    countries. It concluded that plain
                                    packaging had less appeal than branded packaging in low- income settings.

                                    on adolescents in Spain, France, and the USA, and concluded that both policies
                                    impacted on cravings and evoked

                                    settings and found them to be associated with less-positive product perceptions,

                                    smoking, and increased reported feelings about reducing consumption and quit

                                <li>A 2016 study led to results demonstrating that plain packaging and health warnings
                                    work independently and in
                                    unison to influence smokers’ and non-smokers’ behavioral intentions. <sup>25</sup>

                                <li>A 2016 study considered the impact of cigarette packaging design, such as “slims”

                                    labels, on perceptions of taste harm and interest among young females in Canada. The
                                    study concludes that plain
                                    packaging may decrease demand and reduce misleading perceptions in young females.

                            <p>Plain packaging has come into full effect in France and the UK in early 2017. As with

                            <p>The research demonstrates that the policy is starting to have the anticipated impacts on
                                the intended mechanisms of
                                reducing tobacco appeal, increasing the effectiveness of health warnings and reducing
                                misperceptions about the harms
                                of tobacco products. It should nevertheless be recognized that it is a policy intended
                                to have impacts over time. It
                                was introduced at the same time as a number of other tobacco control measures and
                                isolating the specific influence
                                of plain packaging will also take time.</p>

                            <p>The tobacco industry has sought to highlight isolated anomalies in the statistical data
                                to argue that plain packaging
                                has not worked or is having a negative impact. These examples, set out below, have no
                                statistical significance and
                                should not detract from the vast majority of the evidence that all points to the policy
                                working as intended. The
                                tobacco industry has also commissioned reports that try to analyse the statistical data
                                to show that plain packaging
                                has <i>not increased the existing rate of decline</i> in smoking rates. These reports

                                packaging fulfilling its core
                                aims of

                            </p>

                            <p>These research papers also suggest that plain packaging is severely restricting the
                                ability of the pack to
                                communicate and create appeal with adolescents and young people. For instance,
                                school-based surveys with students
                                aged 12–17 years old in 2011 and 2013 show that the removal of branding and uniformity
                                of pack appearance has
                                increased negative pack ratings and decreased positive ones. <sup>3</sup></p>

                                associated
                                with increased thinking about quitting and quit attempts. In addition, dislike of the
                                pack, lower satisfaction from
                                cigarettes and attributing motivation to quit to the warnings predicted daily thoughts
                                of quitting. <sup>4</sup>

                            <p>Research has also found a significant increase in the number of calls to the smoking
                                cessation helpline, Quitline, in
                                NSW and the ACT. <sup>5</sup> The research showed a 78% increase in the number of calls

                            <p>The review concludes that <b><i>“the measure has begun to achieve its public health
                                        objectives of reducing smoking
                                        and
                                        exposure to tobacco smoke in Australia and it is expected to continue to do so
                                        into the future.”</i></b></p>

                            <p>In line with Australian government guidance, the PIR examines the post-implementation
                                evidence, data, and analysis of
                                the broader costs and benefits to industry, government and the wider community, to
                                evaluate the efficiency and
                                effectiveness of the tobacco plain packaging measure. Much of this evidence and data is
                                described in the first two
                                parts of this Section. The PIR provides the Australian Government’s analysis of that
                                evidence.</p>

                            <p><b>The summary of the PIR states that:</b></p>

                            <p class="p-states"><b>“While the full effect of the tobacco plain packaging measure is
                                    expected to be realised over
                                    time,
                                    the evidence examined in this PIR suggests that the measure is achieving its aims.
                                    This evidence shows that
                                    tobacco
                                    plain packaging is having a positive impact on its specific mechanisms as envisaged
                                    in the TPP Act. All of the
                                    major
                                    data sets examined also showed on-going drops in national smoking prevalence in
                                    Australia.</b> These decreases
                                cannot be
                                entirely attributed to plain packaging given the range of tobacco control measures in
                                place in Australia, including
                                media campaigns and Australia’s tobacco excise regime.”</p>

                                The PIR provides an analysis of peer-reviewed research studies into smoking attitudes
                                and behaviors before and after
                                the introduction of the policy. These show that it is having a positive impact on the
                                three specific mechanisms of
                                reducing the appeal of tobacco products, increasing the effectiveness of health
                                warnings, and reducing the ability
                                of the pack to mislead:

                                “Taken as a whole, the studies . . . provide early evidence that the tobacco plain
                                packaging measure is having a
                                positive impact on the three specific mechanisms of reducing the appeal of tobacco
                                products, reducing the potential
                                for tobacco packaging to mislead consumers, and enhancing the effectiveness of graphic
                                health warnings. Studies also
                                provide early evidence that the measure is resulting in positive changes to smoking
                                behaviours. The body of evidence
                                is diverse, including analyses conducted on a range of different groups (including
                                adolescents, adults, cigarette
                                smokers and cigar/cigarillo smokers) and using different datasets (including the
                                National Tracking Survey, the NSW
                                Tracking Survey, the ASSAD data, the ITC Project data and bespoke surveys).”
                            </p>

                            <p>The report also reviews the available data and statistical analysis of smoking prevalence
                                and tobacco consumption
                                rates: </p>

                            <p class="p-states">“All the major data sets show continuing declines in smoking prevalence
                                with substantial declines in
                                the period following the introduction of tobacco plain packaging. Analysis of the Roy
                                Morgan Research data
                                undertaken for the Department (described below) concludes that the 2012 packaging
                                changes have already contributed
                                to the overall decline in smoking prevalence and that over time these impacts will
                                increase.”</p>

                            <p>The use of statistical data can be complex, and the tobacco industry has produced reports
                                that seek to undermine the
                                argument that large reductions in the smoking rates can be attributable to plain
                                packaging of reduced smoking. Thus,
                                for instance, the JTI response to the PIR has been to say that,“The report fails to
                                properly take into account that
                                smoking rates had been steadily declining for years, long before the introduction of
                                this branding ban, and that the
                                measure hasn’t accelerated this decline.” <sup>25</sup></p>

                            <p>Most of the evidence and studies that the PIR refers to and considers was already
                                publicly available. However, the
                                PIR was accompanied by a new detailed data analysis by Dr.TasneemChipty of Analysis
                                Group, Inc., who undertook a
                                regression analysis. This used Roy Morgan Single Source Survey Data to provide an
                                average prevalence rate for the 34
                                months prior to implementation of plain packaging and the 34 months following
                                implementation. Those figures were
                                19.4% and 17.2%, respectively — a 2.2% percentage point drop. </p>

                            <p>Dr Chipty’s analysis estimated that the packaging changes resulted in a <b>“statistically
                                    significant decline in
                                    smoking
                                    prevalence of 0.55 percentage points over the post implementation period, relative
                                    to what the prevalence would
                                    have
                                    been without the packaging changes. This decline accounts for approximately one
                                    quarter of the total decline in
                                    average prevalence rates observed . . .”</b></p>

                            <p>Trying to use statistical analysis of survey data to separate out the effects of
                                different tobacco-control measures
                                is difficult, but it is this detailed report by Dr.Chipty that undermines the tobacco
                                industry claims of no
                                accelerated decline. </p>

                            <p>Dr.Chipty’s analysis was set out in figurative form in the following chart:</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive center-block" width="450px"
                                 src="<?php echo $base_url; ?>img/evidence/australia-2.jpg">

                            <p>This chart plots the monthly overall smoking prevalence rates from the Roy Morgan data,
                                with two separate trend lines
                                for before and after the introduction of the 2012 packaging changes. The chart shows the
                                overall decline in smoking
                                prevalence in Australia over the last fifteen years and provides some indication that
                                the “decline in prevalence has
                                accelerated in recent years.” As regards the effects on the illicit market, the PIR
                                considers the post-
                                implementation data and peer-reviewed studies that found no change in smokers’ reported
                                use of unbranded illicit
                                tobacco, no evidence of increases in use of contraband cigarettes, low levels of use of
                                cigarettes likely to be
                                contraband, and no increase in purchases of tobacco from informal sellers.</p>

                            <p>The PIR concludes that:</p>

                            <p class="p-states">“the measure has begun to achieve its public health objectives of
                                reducing smoking and exposure to

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tobacco industry have mounted well-funded and sophisticated campaigns opposing plain
                            packaging of tobacco products in every country where the policy is taken forward by
                            government. However, the arguments used by opponents of plain packaging are broadly similar
                            in each country.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Governments should take objections to plain packaging, and the veracity of them, into
                            careful consideration when reviewing the evidence for the policy. Not doing so can lead to
                            accusations of an unfair process. But officials can decide what weight or importance they
                            give to these arguments and compare them to the evidence in support of the policy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Tobacco companies have also submitted lengthy responses to public consultations on plain
                            packaging. These submissions provide the detail behind the arguments that headline in the
                            media and are referred to though out these pages.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is important for governments and civil society to mobilise support for tobacco plain
                            packaging and part of that process involves countering the false or deceitful arguments of
                            the tobacco industry. This means anticipating the likely arguments and directly refuting
                            them.

                            Big tobacco strongly argues that there is no reliable evidence to show that plain packaging
                            will reduce smoking rates. The tobacco companies have used this argument in their
                            advertising campaigns in Australia, the UK, France and elsewhere. It is part of the
                            opposition in each jurisdiction that considers the policy.

                            2. Increases illicit tobacco
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            The tobacco industry relies heavily on its claim that plain packaging will increase the
                            illicit trade in tobacco. The argument is one of the main issues raised in its media
                            campaigns, in its submissions to government, and in its legal arguments before the courts.
                            However, this claim lacks both logic and evidence. It is made in three ways:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Plain packs will be easier and cheaper to counterfeit than the existing complex branded
                                packs;
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Smokers prefer branded packs and are more like to purchase illicit tobacco that has
                                branded packaging if legal tobacco is in plain packs; and
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Illicit trade in tobacco has increased in Australia after the implementation of plain
                                packaging.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            The tobacco industry commissions statistical data on the illicit trade in tobacco for many
                            countries, often using the flawed “empty pack” survey method. In each country that has
                            considered plain packaging, the tobacco companies promote media articles raising fears about
                            illicit tobacco. Leaked internal documents from Philip Morris show this was a central pillar
                            of their strategy to oppose the policy<sup>1</sup>
                            Research shows that the tobacco industry uses inflated estimates of illicit
                            trade.<sup>2</sup>

                        <br>&nbsp;<br>
                        <p>
                            For example, in the UK, research has shown that in the two years before plain packaging
                            proposals were announced, there were no media articles about the illicit trade in tobacco.
                            In the two years after plain packaging was first proposed, 52 stories appeared in the media
                            about rising rates of illicit tobacco, all of which cited tobacco industry data rather than
                            the official government statistics, which showed the rates were declining. <sup>3</sup>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A similar situation occurred in Slovenia with many news articles raising concerns about
                            smuggled cigarettes appearing during the period when the government was considering plain
                            packaging.
                            <sup>4</sup>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The industry then links these concerns about the illicit trade to argue against plain
                            packaging laws. In some countries, tobacco companies have even produced short promotional
                            films <sup>5</sup>
                            that raise fears about crime and terrorism, which they say will result from plain packaging.<sup>6</sup>

                                response</a> to the most recent consultation on plain packaging in Canada <sup>7</sup>
                            provides a
                            typical example of the industry arguments. It stated:
                        </p>

                        <p class="p-states">
                            “In a plain pack environment, illegal producers will benefit at the expense of legitimate
                            industry. They would be able to replicate easily plain packs and continue to supply the
                            Canadian market with illegal branded packs and clear plastic baggies of cigarettes without
                            health warnings. “ [p. 3]
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JTI’s submission relied only on industry funded, discredited data about the extent of
                            contraband tobacco in Canada. It ignored the independent research and official data that
                            shows the illicit market has decreased in recent years. <sup>8</sup>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JTI also asserted that plain packs will be easier to counterfeit [paragraph 148]. The only
                            research cited is a report from 2012, commissioned by JTI, by Zimmerman and
                            Chaudhary,<sup>9</sup>
                            which
                            has been the subject of academic criticism <sup>10</sup>. There is no independent
                            peer-reviewed
                            research
                            to back up JTI’s argument.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JTI also claims that:
                        </p>

                        <p class="p-states">
                            “The level of illegal tobacco consumption in Australia has grown more than 20% since plain
                            packaging was introduced.” [paragraph 149]
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To support this assertion JTI relied solely on data from a report by KPMG. That study uses
                            an “empty pack” survey, which has been shown to have significant flaws in its methodology
                            . <sup>12</sup>
                            Even that KPMG survey has found no counterfeit plain packs over four years. KPMG has written
                            to the UK Public Health Minister to state that the report has been “misrepresented by
                            others, without our consent, to suggest it supports the contention that plain paper
                            packaging could lead of itself to an increase in tobacco smuggling and duty avoidance.”
                            <sup>13</sup>
                            JTI
                            ignored the official statistics and research that demonstrates the levels of illicit trade
                            has remained constant (see below).

                        <p>
                            The tobacco companies argue that plain packaging will commoditize tobacco, meaning that the
                            only way to compete is on price which will lead to price reductions which in turn will then
                            lead to increased demand.

                        <p>
                            A number of the “unintended consequences” suggested by the tobacco industry center on the
                            assertion that standardized packaging would cause tobacco product prices to drop, especially
                            in the premium segment of the market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tobacco companies have, for many years, invested in building premium brands, for which
                            consumers are willing to pay more. The tobacco industry say that, with plain packaging,
                            smokers would no longer be willing to make purchasing decisions based on a brand identity,
                            with premium brands having the greatest to lose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tobacco companies claim that, where branding cannot be used, this will lead to increased
                            price competition instead (sometimes referred to as “commoditization”), which will lead to
                            lower-priced tobacco products. Lower-cost tobacco leads to increased demand. The tobacco
                            companies use this argument to suggest that plain packaging will actually increase smoking
                            rates (or reduce the rate of decline).

                            In a plain packaging environment, it will become ever more difficult to sell products in

                            In addition, each of the tobacco companies has said that they believe that there would, in
                            time, be increased “<b>downtrading</b>” (or brand switching), whereby smokers choose to
                            purchase
                            lower priced brands instead of more expensive premium brands as a result of plain packaging.
                            If there is less perceived ‘”status’” to be gained from identifying as a consumer of a
                            high-end brand, which may be the case if tobacco packs were standardized, some say that
                            smokers will switch to cheaper alternatives and price would become the key way to
                            differentiate between products.

                        <p>
                            This, they claim, would mean that overall, the price of purchased tobacco would be lower and
                            that downtrading stimulates demand.

                            companies submitted expert evidence, <sup>1</sup> which they claimed demonstrated that
                            plain
                            packaging
                            would increase smoking rates (or would reduce the existing downward trend of those rates).
                            That expert evidence included lengthy and complex economic analysis. Fundamental to these
                            economic models was the assumption that plain packaging will significantly increase
                            downtrading.

                            The judge in the UK case rejected these arguments, stating not only had the government
                            proved its case but also that the evidence submitted by the tobacco companies had
                            fundamental methodological flaws. <sup>2</sup>

                            In the cases that were dismissed in the UK and French administrative courts, the tobacco
                            companies argued that plain packaging breaches national trademark law; breaches rights, such
                            as freedom of expression and freedom to conduct a business; and violates a number of the
                            World Trade Organization agreements, intellectual property treaties, and regional free trade

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Big tobacco argues that plain packaging will negatively impact small retailers and that it
                            will increase transaction times for serving tobacco.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Australia, the UK, and France, the tobacco companies argued that plain packaging would
                            have negative impacts on small retailers. The industry regularly provides funds to national
                            retailer associations <sup>1</sup>, and those associations then oppose tobacco control
                            regulation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For instance, in Australia, a study commissioned by the Alliance of Australian Retailers
                            (AAR) concluded that:
                        </p>

                        <p class="p-states">
                            “retailing times would be adversely affected if standardised packaging were introduced by an
                            additional 15 to 45 seconds per transaction and that the effect would be particularly
                            significant for smaller retailers.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The AAR set up a website to oppose plain packaging (a screen shot is shown below). However,
                            the AAR was a tobacco industry front group financed by Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, and
                            British American Tobacco (BAT). Internal tobacco industry and AAR documents that were leaked
                            to the media revealed that the Alliance was set up and run by the tobacco industry to lobby
                            against plain packaging <sup>2</sup>. This is an example of Astroturfing, a campaign
                            pretending to
                            be a
                            grassroots initiative, while hiding its true origin, goal, and funding.

                            Similarly, in the UK, the tobacco industry funded a campaign run by the Tobacco Retailers
                            Alliance that claimed to be a “coalition of 26,000 independent shopkeepers,” but which was
                            established by the industry to oppose tobacco-control measures. ,<sup>3</sup>

                            The NFRN was extremely vocal in its opposition to plain packaging and produced postcards
                            that were placed in retail outlets across the UK with misleading images of white plain
                            packs, suggesting that plain packaging legislation will lead to increases in illicit trade,
                            organized crime and terrorism, loss of tax revenue, and more children smoking:. <sup>5</sup>

                            However, the strong evidence from Australia is that plain packaging has had no real impact
                            on small retailers. This may be the reason why this argument was not used by either JTI or
                            Imperial Tobacco in their consultation responses to the Canadian 2016 consultation.

                            Will lead to plain packaging of other products the slippery slope / domino effect
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            A key argument used in the tobacco industry media campaigns in many countries is that if
                            plain packaging for tobacco is introduced, it sets a precedent for other consumer products,
                            such as soft drinks, alcohol, or fatty foods. The argument is that plain packaging is a step
                            too far towards a “nanny state” and will lead to reduced product innovation across all
                            sectors. In this way, the tobacco industry tries to get support from the other industries in
                            opposing the policy generally.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This argument is often put forward in campaigns and media articles by third-party
                            organizations, posing as independent voices but which receive funding from the tobacco
                            industry.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For instance, in the UK, the “<a href="http://www.handsoffourpacks.com/">Hands Off Our
                                Packs</a>” campaign, run by
                            <a href="http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/Forest">FOREST</a>, strongly pushed
                            this argument forward. The Institute for Economic Affairs, a libertarian think tank, hosted
                            events and published papers opposing plain packaging, using the slippery slope argument. It
                            was an issue regularly cited in media articles about those that oppose plain packaging.
                            <sup>1</sup>
                            Imperial Tobacco UK also deployed the slippery slope argument in an anti-plain packaging
                            <a href="">YouTube video</a> advert in Britain — 2020 Vision. <sup>2</sup> The advert
                            misleadingly
                            suggests that by 2020
                            all products perceived to be unhealthy will be sold in plain packaging. The advert was
                            promoted through the distribution of leaflets on petrol forecourts.

                            In Sweden, the UK, and Canada, the tobacco industry, or groups opposing the plain packaging
                            of tobacco, have even set up whole fake shops as media stunts, where all the products, such
                            as drink, crisps, coffee, etc., are in mock plain packaging with health warnings. The images

                        <p>
                            The tobacco companies make this argument because it is important for some of the legal tests
                            on the justification or proportionality of a regulatory measure. For instance, under Article
                            2.2 of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade agreement, a technical measure should “not be
                            more trade-restrictive than <i>necessary</i> to fulfil a legitimate objective.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The legal test as to whether or not a measure is <i>necessary</i> involves considering if
                            there are
                            less restrictive alternatives that would have an equal effect in achieving the public health
                            objective
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The tobacco companies all argue that there are less restrictive measures than plain
                            packaging. The alternatives the companies put forward as being effective and proportionate

                            Many of the tobacco company consultation submissions listed here include the position that
                            these alternative measures should be introduced instead of plain packaging and that they
                            would be more effective at reducing smoking rates and would be less restrictive on trade and
                            intellectual property rights.

                            It is notable that, in the context of plain packaging, the tobacco companies argue that
                            higher taxation, even in an already high tax market, is a policy that “obviously works” to
                            reduce smoking rates. Where the tobacco companies seek to resist tax increases they argue
                            the opposite.

                            Also notable is that in court PMI, JTI and Imperial all abandoned any reliance on
                            alternative measures being effective other than taxation. Only BAT continued to argue that
                            in addition to tax, numerous alterative, less restrictive and equally effective measures
                            could be introduced.

                            The tobacco companies seek to blur the overwhelming view of marketing theory and evidence
                            that advertising affects overall consumption of a product. This despite all the internal
                            tobacco industry documents to the contrary (see theTobacco Branding pageof the Tools and
                            Resources).

                        <p>
                            Tobacco companies argue that branding only promotes brand switching by current smokers and
                            has no effect on overall primary demand. They say that even a small amount of brand
                            switching is worth a lot of money to them. However, cigarette brands enjoy the highest brand
                            loyalty of all consumer products, with fewer than 10 percent changing brands annually. Brand
                            choices are usually made early in the life of a smoker, with a high concordance between
                            brand first smoked and the brand eventually selected as a usual brand. Thus, once a smoker
                            embraces a cigarette brand, it is quite unlikely that they will change.

                            advertising are not the same and should not be conflated. It claims that fundamental
                            marketing theory shows that in a “mature market,” such as in Norway (where growth has slowed
                            and awareness of the product is universal), marketing is not to persuade non-users to try
                            the product but to persuade existing users to swap brands. They argue that branding promotes
                            brands not the act of smoking. <sup>6</sup>

                            Tobacco companies have been making this argument about the role of advertising in mature
                            markets for nearly three decades to seek to prevent any restrictions on tobacco advertising.
                            It is noted in the US Surgeon General’s report that, at a congressional hearing in 1989, an
                            industry spokesperson claimed that the function of advertising in a mature market “is to
                            promote brand loyalty or brand switching.” <sup>7</sup> Even then it was highlighted
                            that textbooks
                            state
                            that when faced with a so-called mature market, advertising firms can and often should
                            attempt to both increase usage among existing customers and to address potential new
                            users. <sup>8</sup>
                            The surgeon general also pointed out that the strongest indicator that tobacco companies
                            must seek out large numbers of new users stems from the feature of the tobacco market that
                            millions of its customers die every year and millions more quit. The only way to maintain
                            the mature market is to recruit new users.

                            <p>The tobacco industry claims that plain packaging interferes with itstrademark rights in a
                                way that conflicts with domestic, regional, and international intellectual property laws
                                and obligations. Most of itsarguments rely— in some way— on the contention that
                                registered trademarksafford the owner a <i>positive right to use</i> that trademark.
                                They argue that this principle is found in international law, under the World Trade
                                Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
                                (TRIPS)as well as being recognized under national trademark laws as either an implicit
                                or explicit right.</p>

                                also show that they received advice from their own lawyers, and from the director of the
                                World Intellectual Property Organization, dating as far back as 1994, that plain
                                packaging would not breach international intellectual property law.<sup>4</sup></p>

                            <p>In recent decisions, courts and tribunals havealso rejected this argument. Instead, these
                                bodies have adopted a traditional view thattrademark rights allow the owner to prevent
                                other people from using the trademark. This “right to exclude”does not include an
                                absoluteright to use the trademark in any and all situations but is limited,
                                particularly where a government is regulating and limiting the use inthe public

                                However, in some countries, the trademark legislation is drafted to afford the owner an

                            <p>The tobacco companies’ constitutional legal claim against plain packaging in Australia
                                led to a decision on the nature of the trademark right under the Australian
                                Constitution. The Australian High Court ruled that the right conferred by trademarks was
                                exclusive in nature and could only be asserted to stop others from using the mark. The
                                right could not be used to prevent government regulations that restricted the companies’
                                use of their trademarks. The Court said:</p>

                            <ul class="no-list-style">
                                <li>
                                    <p>“Strictly speaking, the right subsisting in the owner of a trademark is a
                                        negative and not a positive right. It is to be understood as a right to exclude
                                        others from using the mark and cannot be viewed as separate from the trade in
                                        connection with which it is used.” [para 348]</p>

                                right,” intellectual property law issues are complex. Plain packaging policies do place
                                strict restrictions and controls on the use of trademarks on product packaging. Given
                                these restrictions it is important that separate legal consideration is given to the way

                            <p>While there may be some complexity to these legal arguments, they are basically a

                                remaining place that word and figurative trademarks for tobacco products is still
                                permitted and so can perform these essential functions. The tobacco companies argue that
                                courts have upheld the fundamental importance of these essential functions of
                                trademarks.</p>

                                use their trademarks, the reputation of those marks will be reduced, and thus they will
                                lose protections that were previously guaranteed under national law.

                            <p>The tobacco companies claim that restricting or controlling the use of trademarks on the
                                packaging of tobacco products through plain packaging laws, has the effect of “taking”
                                or “appropriating” their property rights in those trademarks.</p>
                            <p>It is generally accepted that trademarks are a form of property, and so there is the
                                potential for the trademarks rights to be taken or acquired by others. The issue is then
                                whether plain packaging laws result in a regulatory or indirect “taking” for which
                                tobacco companies should receive compensation.</p>
                            <p>Property rights, or the freedom to peaceful enjoyment of property, are protected in many
                                countries’ constitutions, as well as in regional Human Rights treaties. In addition,
                                foreign investors are given protections under international investment treaties to
                                prevent the unlawful “expropriation” of their investments by states. Different
                                jurisdictions use different terminology for this taking, such as
                                “expropriation,”“acquisition,” or “deprivation” and varying legal tests are applied.
                                These claims that plain packaging amounts to expropriation of these rights have been
                                rejected by courts across all jurisdictions:</p>

                            <p>In any system of rights, there is a balance to be struck between competing rights and
                                freedoms. The freedoms relied upon by the tobacco industry are never expressed in
                                absolute terms and are always subject to laws enacted for the public interest. In many
                                legal systems, the freedom of <i>commercial</i> expression is given a lower priority
                                than other forms of expression, such as political or journalistic freedom of expression.
                                In the case of plain packaging laws, freedom of expression must be balanced against the
                                right to life or health, or simply the inherent right of the state to regulate for the

                            <p>However, in some jurisdictions these freedoms are given greater priority. For instance,
                                in the USA, the priority given to the right to commercial freedom of expression would
                                make it more difficult for plain packaging to get past constitutional objections. In
                                Sweden, a public inquiry into a review of the Tobacco Control Act stated that plain
                                packaging of tobacco would be compliant with the European Convention Human Rights and
                                all European Union law but would not be compatible with the current provisions of the
                                Freedom of the Press Act; and should only be introduced if an exception making such a
                                requirement is introduced in the Constitution.<sup>15</sup></p>
                            <p>An assessment of these issues needs to be undertaken for each country. However, all the
                                courts that have considered the legislation thus far have found that plain packaging
                                regulation is no different to regulations for warnings or labeling imposed on other
                                products, especially potentially dangerous consumer products. For plain packaging, the
                                balance has always been found to be in favor of the government’s right to regulate to
                                protect public health rather than commercial interests.</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>These arguments concern the justification for the measure considering the benefit of the
                                public interest relative to the burden it places on the applicant. Similar principles
                                are applied across many legal jurisdictions, both national and international, and
                                consider whether or not the measure has a legitimate objective and if the measure is
                                both suitable and necessary to achieve its objectives.</p>
                            <p>There is often a balancing of the importance of the objective, the extent to which the
                                measure is capable of achieving the objective, and the degree of interference with an
                                applicant’s interests. <a

                                    Set policy objectives</a>, describes the importance of setting clear and measurable
                                objectives for plain packaging. Without clear objectives, courts are faced with a more
                                difficult task in determining this balance. </p>
                            <p>Courts are generally willing to accept that tobacco control measures have a legitimate
                                public health objective. The tobacco industry seeks to argue that there is no evidence
                                to support the contention that plain packaging will be effective to reduce smoking rates
                                (and so it is unsuitable to meet its objectives) and that there are alternative more
                                effective measures at reducing smoking rates (and so plain packaging is
                                <i>unnecessary</i>).</p>
                            <p>A court or tribunal must therefore undertake an analysis of the evidence in support of
                                the measure to see if it is justified. The intensity of that analysis, the margin of
                                appreciation, or how much deference is given to the government in taking decisions about
                                public health will vary between jurisdictions.</p>
                            <p>For instance, in their challenge to the UK Regulations, the tobacco companies claimed

                                            suitable or appropriate to meet this objective because it has failed to
                                            establish that the Regulations will cause a material decrease in smoking

                                This issue concerns the way in which a government conducted the policy development and
                                legislative process. The tobacco industry will often argue that tobacco control measures
                                were adopted:

                                <li>without using fair and transparent procedures; or</li>
                                <li>using procedures that are not in accordance with a country’s constitutional and

                                    the tobacco companies made different technical due-process claims. These were
                                    rejected by the courts in both cases, but these are fact specific issues that
                                    concern the procedures used by each government.

                            <p>The dissenting opinion of one of the arbitrators in the <i>PMI v. Uruguay</i> case held
                                that there was no documentary record that the Ministry of Health had given any proper

                                treatment.”While the majority of the tribunal did not agree, this acts as a cautionary
                                reminder that to protect against tobacco industry legal challenges, officials should
                                ensure both proper consideration of the evidence and issues, and make careful records of

                            <p>World Trade Organization (WTO) law limits the way in which WTO Members may restrict or
                                regulate international trade in goods and services, and also imposes obligations on the
                                protection of intellectual property rights. The law is enforced through a system of
                                dispute settlement between its Members. This means only the governments of other WTO
                                Member States may bring a complaint that may then be referred to a dispute panel. A
                                panel ruling may be appealed to the Appellate Body.</p>
                            <p>The tobacco companies regularly allege in letters and submissions to governments that
                                effective tobacco packaging and labeling laws, including large health warnings and plain
                                packaging, breach the WTO agreements. Ministry of Health officials need to be robust in
                                responding to or dealing with these allegations.</p>
                            <p>At the time of writing, a WTO panel is determining complaints against Australia’s plain
                                packaging laws brought by Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Indonesia. The
                                ruling is expected in July 2017. More details about this case are given in the <a

                                WTO Members have to regulate in the public interest and that protection of human health

                            </h3>
                            <p>International Investment Treaties (IITs) are agreements between two or more countries.
                                These agreements give investors located in one party to the IIT protections and legal
                                security for their direct investments into the other party or parties to the IIT. The
                                purpose of IITs is to encourage more direct foreign investment. Almost all nations
                                across the globe have signed up to these agreements and the protections they afford to
                                foreign investors.</p>
                            <p>Most IITs include what is known as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions.
                                These provisions provide a system for foreign investors to commence an arbitration claim
                                if the investor believes the government of the host nation has breached their
                                obligations under the IIT. The measures that are challenged can sometimes be genuine,
                                public-interest policies or decisions to protect the environment or public health but
                                which in some way affect the use of the investment or its value.</p>
                            <p><span class="fc-ref-mat-4"><b>These claims can be for millions, sometimes billions of dollars in compensation, and the arbitration lawsuits typically take many years to resolve and involve huge legal bills.</b></span>
                                However, one of the primary aims of the tobacco industry in bringing these claims is to
                                create “regulatory chilling effect” and deter other governments from enacting effective
                                tobacco-control regulation. </p>

                                and its Single Presentation Requirement; the second against Australia’s plain packaging

                                1.1 Constitutional challenge in the High Court of Australia — dismissed in August 2012
                            </h3>
                            <p><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2012/43.html">JTInternational SA v.
                                    Commonwealth of Australia [2012] HCA 43 (5 October, 2012)</a></p>
                            <p>The four major tobacco companies challenged the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 based on
                                section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, which deals with the acquisition of property by
                                the state. </p>
                            <p>The two principle arguments were that plain-packaging laws were a breach of the
                                constitution because they amounted to an acquisition of the tobacco companies’
                                intellectual property rights including trademarks‘and that the government’s use of or
                                control over the packaging itself amounted to an acquisition of property.</p>
                            <p>The High Court ruled in the Government’s favor by 6 to 1.</p>
                            <p>One judge observed that the tobacco companies’ most strenuous objection was the taking
                                <i>“of the advertising or promotional functions of their registered trademarks.”</i></p>
                            <p>The High Court held that, to be an acquisition, the Government must obtain a benefit or
                                interest of a “proprietary nature.” One judge stated that <i>“on no view can it be said
                                    that the Commonwealth. . . has acquired any benefit of a proprietary character”</i>;
                                and another that the requirements of the Act <i>“are no different in kind from any
                                    legislation that requires labels that warn against the use or misuse of a
                                    product.”</i>Moreover,that <i>“[m]any kinds of products have been subjected to
                                    regulation in order to prevent or reduce the likelihood of harm, including
                                    medicines, poisonous substances and foods.”</i></p>

                                International (JTI) and Imperial Tobacco compare the cigarette packet to advertising
                                billboards by saying that Australia <i>“is acquiring our billboard, your Honour”</i>;
                                and <i>“I own this packet and I will determine what message goes on it”</i>. . . it is
                                our <i>“bonsai billboard.”</i></p>

                            <p>Philip Morris Asia brought a claim under a bilateral investment treaty between Australia
                                and Hong Kong to obtain compensation for losses it claimed were due to the
                                plain-packaging laws. The two main arguments of Philip Morris were: that plain packaging
                                had the equivalent effect of “expropriating” the property rights in its trademarks that
                                could no longer be used on packaging; and that the measure was “arbitrary” and
                                “unreasonable” on the basis that there was no evidence it would work. </p>
                            <p>However, in order to bring the claim, Philip Morris International restructured, so that
                                ownership of 100% of its shares in Philip Morris Australia were transferred from PMI
                                (based in Switzerland) to Philip Morris Asia (based in Hong Kong) <i>after</i> the
                                Australian government had announced its intention to adopt plain packaging of tobacco
                                products. The arbitration tribunal found that this was done for the sole purpose of
                                bringing a claim under the investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia and the
                                claim was therefore <i>“an abuse of rights.”</i> The tribunal therefore declined
                                jurisdiction, and the merits of the claim were not considered. </p>

                            <p>The dispute arose out of complaints by Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia,
                                and Ukraine that the plain-packaging laws breach various articles of the WTO agreements,
                                and a dispute settlement panel was composed in May 2014. The final oral hearing took
                                place in October 2015, and final summary written submissions were made in December 2015.
                                The On May 28, 2015, Ukraine suspended their dispute in order to negotiate a mutually
                                agreed solution with Australia. The panel has stated that its ruling will be given not
                                before May 2017. It is possible for parties to appeal to the WTO's Appellate Body.</p>

                                    because it is an unjustifiable encumbrance on the use of tobacco trademarks;
                                </li>
                                <li>the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) because it is more
                                    trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective; and

                                <li>the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) because it provides imported

                                the fact that there are more third-party WTO member states that have made written and
                                oral submissions to the panel than for any previous WTO dispute — some 34 countries plus
                                the EU. It has been reported that Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are

                            <p>This is an important judgment that has wider international significance. The ruling dealt
                                with the merits of most of the key legal issues set out above in section 2. The judge
                                gave particular attention to issues of international relevance including —the importance
                                of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); the public health
                                justification for plain-packaging laws; the issue of whether or not there is a right to
                                use trademarks; and a detailed analysis of the evidence that supported the policy and
                                the tobacco companies’ evidence submitted to oppose the policy. </p>

                                considered by any government taking forward plain packaging. This is the first judgment
                                that provides a careful scrutiny of that evidence, confirming that it meets relevant
                                legal tests.</p>

                            <p><i><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-547/14">R (Philip Morris Brands
                                        Sarl & Others) v. Secretary of State for Health C–547</a></i></p>
                            <p>The aim of the EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) is to provide a harmonized regulatory
                                environment for tobacco products across the EU (including on emissions, health warnings,
                                labeling, and reporting requirements) to assist the free movement of those goods. In
                                doing so, the Directive takes a high standard of public health. Some provisions of the
                                TPD introduce elements of a plain-packaging policy, such as the requirement for cuboid
                                cigarette packs with flip top lids, and a minimum of 20 cigarettes per pack. The TPD
                                also includes, inArticle 24(2), a provision that member states may adopt further
                                measures in relation to the standardization of tobacco packaging. </p>
                            <p>The four major international tobacco companies commenced a legal claim in the UK courts,
                                challenging the government’s intention to implement the TPD on the basis that the
                                Directive was not validly made. The High Court referred questions of interpretation of
                                EU law to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The legal challenge sought
                                to overturn the whole Directive on a number of different grounds and also challenged the
                                validity of separate parts of the TPD, including Article 24(2).</p>
                            <p>All grounds of challenge were dismissed and the validity of the Directive upheld. The
                                importance of the FCTC was highlighted by the CJEU, which emphasized that its guidelines
                                could have “decisive influence” on the interpretation of EU laws on tobacco control. But
                                the key aspect of the judgment relevant to plain packaging, is that the Court of Justice
                                confirmed that the Tobacco Products Directive permits EU Member States to introduce
                                measures to standardize the packaging of tobacco products. </p>
                            <p>The opinion of the Advocate General (adopted by the Court) confirmed that measures to
                                standardize packs contribute to increasing the visibility of health warnings and that
                                these measures are proportionate because purely economic interests in the functioning of
                                the tobacco market are secondary to the protection of human health.</p>

                                        n° 2015–727 DC du 21 Janvier 2016</a></i></p>
                            <p>Legislation providing powers to introduce plain packaging was adopted by the Assemblée
                                Nationale as part of Law n°2016–41 on the Modernization of the Health System and came
                                into force on January 26, 2016. The constitutional appeal was filed by members of
                                parliament and concerned the entirety of the law (of which plain-packaging provisions
                                were just one part). The plain-packaging measures were challenged on the basis of the
                                legislative process, the constitutional rights to property and free enterprise, and on
                                the proportionality of the measures.</p>
                            <p>The Constitutional Council noted that the brand name can still be applied to packages
                                allowing for clear identification of the product. It held that the rights of the
                                trademark owner to exclude the use by others are still respected through this. It also
                                held that there was no expropriation of property but a limitation on the property rights
                                justified by the objective of protecting public health, because the plain-packaging
                                measure made it possible to prevent the pack from becoming a piece of advertising. The
                                Court noted the measure does not prohibit the production, distribution, or otherwise the
                                sale of tobacco products. Accordingly, the measure was held to be a proportionate
                                infringement of the rights of commerce and free enterprise. </p>

                                March 22, 2016, and came into force May 20, 2016.</p>
                            <p>JTI launched an action on April 29, 2016, at the level of the Conseil d’État (the highest
                                administrative court) alleging that the laws are in breach of the French constitution.
                                Similar actions were launched by Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, and British American
                                Tobacco; by the Confédération Nationale des Buralistes de France (the National
                                Organization for Tobacco Retailers in France); and by République Technologie (a
                                cigarette-paper manufacturer) in May 2016.</p>
                            <p>The petitioners contended that the measures constituted an infringement of fundamental
                                rights relating to property; that they disregarded the principle of free enterprise;
                                that they infringed the constitutional principle of clarity and intelligibility of the
                                law; that they violated the provisions of trademark rights and intellectual property;
                                that they constitute an assault on France’s international commitments under the European

                            <p><b><i>JTI v. Minister for Health, Ireland, and the Attorney General 2015/2530P</i></b>
                            </p>
                            <p>Legislation for plain packaging on all tobacco products was adopted on March 10, 2015,
                                and was due to come into force on May 20, 2016.However, some amendments were required to
                                the law, and the likely coming into force date is now in 2017. JTI issued legal
                                proceedings in 2015 challenging the Irish legislation. Following an initial hearing, JTI
                                confirmed that its claim was based solely on the ground that the law is incompatible
                                with the EU Tobacco Production Directive (TPD). The proceedings were stayed pending the
                                outcome of the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling on the tobacco companies’
                                challenge to the TPD (see above 3.1). In addition, JTI explicitly stated that it
                                reserves its position in relation to all other potential grounds pending the outcome of
                                the UK High Court ruling (see above 2.1). Once the EU and UK cases were dismissed, JTI’s
                                claim was then struck out. Ireland has a constitution that protects property rights with
                                no limitation period; therefore, a constitutional challenge may be brought at some stage
                                whatever the outcomes of the other cases, and it is understood that JTI formally
                                reserved its position on this issue.</p>

                            <p>This case was not a challenge to plain packaging but rather two other packaging laws
                                introduced in Uruguay in 2008 and 2009, stipulating:</p>
                            <ul class="no-list-style">
                                <li>1. that large graphic health warnings should cover 80% of the front and back of
                                    cigarette packets.
                                </li>
                                <li>2. that each cigarette brand be limited to just a single variant or brand type
                                    (eliminating brand families to address evidence that some variants can mislead
                                    consumers and falsely imply some cigarettes are less harmful than others) — known as
                                    the Single Presentation Requirement (SPR).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However, the arguments put forward by Philip Morris in this investment arbitration claim
                                are very similar to those used in the investment arbitration case against Australia’s
                                plain packaging. Consequently, the ruling is highly relevant to the legality of plain
                                packaging under international investment law. The Australian claim was dismissed on
                                jurisdiction grounds, whereas the tribunal in this case determined the merits of the
                                legal arguments and dismissed all grounds ofclaim.PMI alleged that the two measures
                                violated a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with Switzerland<sup>5</sup> and brought
                                the claim after legal challenges in Uruguay’s domestic courts by the Philip Morris
                                subsidiaries had failed. It sought an order for the repeal of the Challenged Measures
                                and for compensation in the region of $25 million. </p>
                            <p>The landmark ruling highlighted the importance of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco
                                Control (FCTC) in setting tobacco-control objectives and establishing the evidence base
                                for measures. The ruling confirmed that states need not recreate local evidence to
                                justify tobacco-control measures. It addressed the wide “margin of appreciation” and
                                deference provided to sovereign states in adopting measures or decisions concerning
                                public health. </p>
                            <p>The ruling sets an extremely high bar for any foreign investor seeking to bring an
                                investment arbitration challenge against a non-discriminatory public health measure that
                                has a legitimate objective and that has been taken in good faith.</p>
                            <p>The arbitrator appointed by PMI, Gary Born, agreed with the ruling on most aspects but
                                gave a <b>dissenting opinion</b> on two issues. One of these was that the SPR had been
                                adopted in an arbitrary manner and therefore breached the obligation of <i>fair and
                                    equitable treatment</i>. Part of his reasoning was that there was, in his view, no
                                record of any proper consideration of the evidence and issues by Uruguay before adopting
                                the measure (See <a

                        <p>
                            Plain packaging of tobacco is a common sense policy that removes the promotional, marketing
                            and advertising features on packs of tobacco, but leaves the health warnings, tax stamps and
                            other features required by government. Most governments have increased the size of the
                            health warnings at the same time as introducing plain packaging. The main elements of a
                            plain packaging of tobacco policy are:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Packaging must be a <b>uniform plain unattractive color</b> usually a dull brown/green;
                            </li>
                            <li>All packs must be a <b>standard shape, size and texture</b>, and be made from cardboard;
                            </li>
                            <li><b>No branding, logos or other promotional elements</b> can appear on the packaging - or
                                on individual cigarette sticks;
                            </li>
                            <li>The brand and product name can appear on each pack, as well as the quantity of product
                                in the pack and manufacturer’s contact details, but in a standard size, color and
                                typeface.
                            </li>
                            <li>Health warnings, tax stamps and other government requirements remain on the packs.</li>

                        <p>
                            Packaging for all products can act as a form of promotion, marketing and advertising. This
                            is even truer for tobacco because in countries where other advertising is restricted, the
                            pack becomes the main means of promoting tobacco; and tobacco is a ‘badge product’ which
                            people carry around with them and display every time they take the pack out.<sup>1</sup>

                        <p>Brightly coloured and attractive branding distracts attention from the health warnings</p>
                        <p>Even where misleading descriptors such as ‘light’ and ‘mild’ have been banned, branded
                            packaging continues to create
                            strong but false perceptions that some variants are less harmful than others. These ‘health
                            reassurance’ brands use
                            light and bright colors to mislead consumers and help to maintain addiction. </p>

                            In the legal claim in the Australian High Court, counsel for Japan Tobacco International
                            argued that tobacco packaging acted like an advertising billboard.

                        <div class="section-secondary-title fc-ref-mat-4">Plain or Standardised?</div>
                        <p>
                            The most commonly used term for the policy is ‘<b>plain packaging</b>’ – this is the term
                            used by
                            Australia and the WHO. But because packs retain the health warnings they are not literally
                            ‘plain’, and the industry has tried to spread confusion about this. In the UK and Ireland
                            the term used is ‘<b>standardised packaging</b>’. In France the term used is ‘<b>neutral
                                packaging</b>’
                            and elsewhere governments have called it ‘<b>generic packaging</b>’. These are all different
                            terms
                            for the same policy.

                        <p>
                            Plain packaging helps to change smoking attitudes and behaviours and reduce the overall
                            demand for tobacco. It is likely to have a greater impact on younger people. Plain
                            packaging:

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Reduces the appeal and attractiveness</b> of tobacco products to consumers,</li>
                            <li><b>Increases the noticeability and effectiveness of health warnings</b> on the packaging

                        </div>
                        <p>Yes. There have been five international systematic evidence reviews that considered all the
                            peer reviewed research studies from around the globe on the impact of plain packaging on
                            smoking behaviours and attitudes. <sup>2</sup> All concluded that the policy would be
                            effective at
                            contributing to its objectives.</p>

                        <p>In Australia, over 4 years of post-implementation data shows continued significant declines
                            in smoking rates. <sup>3</sup> The government’s post implementation review concluded that
                            a 0.55
                            percentage point drop could be attributed to plain packaging <b>(equivalent to 118,000 less
                                people smoking <sup>4</sup> over 3 years)</b>,</p>

                        <p>The tobacco industry has refused to release any of its own internal research into the impacts
                            of plain packaging. The studies the tobacco companies rely on to oppose plain packaging are
                            almost universally not peer reviewed; are unverifiable; and either ignore or airily dismiss
                            the global evidence that supports the policy being effective. <sup>5</sup></p>

                        <p><sup>34</sup> EU Tobacco Products Directive introduces some pack standardization provisions
                            (on shape and minimum quantities together with 65 percent front and back picture health
                            warnings) but does not itself impose full standardized packaging. Instead it provides the EU
                            Member States with the ability to act directly through domestic legislation (“Accordingly,
                            Member States could, for example, introduce provisions providing for further standardization
                            of the packaging of tobacco products, provided that those provisions are compatible with the
                            TFEU [Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union], with WTO obligations and do not
                            affect the full application of this Directive.” Article 24.2 Directive 2014/40/EU of the

                        <p>The tobacco companies argue that once they have registered their trademarks they have a
                            ‘right to use’ those trademarks. But international intellectual property treatiesdeal with
                            registration procedures and how trade mark owners can stop others from using their marks.
                            International rules do not give the owners of registered trademarks a ‘right to use’ them
                            that overrides a states’ powers to regulate for the public good. </p>

                        <p>The court rulings dismissing the legal challenges in Australia, France and the United Kingdom
                            have all been clear - plain packaging does not breach either domestic or international
                            intellectual property laws and obligations.</p>
                        <p>The High Court in Australia pointed out that plain packaging is no different in kind from
                            other packaging or labelling requirement.</p>
                        <p>As far back as 1994, disclosed internal industry documents show that the tobacco companies
                            had advice from their own lawyers and from the World Intellectual Property Organisation
                            (WIPO), that plain packaging would not contravene the international intellectual property
                            rules <sup>8</sup></p>

                        <p><b>Reductions in smoking lead to significant health care savings in the short term</b>. A new
                            study
                            from the US showed that a 10% relative drop in smoking (meaning, for instance, a drop from
                            20% to 18%) would be followed by an expected $63 billion reductionin healthcare expenditure
                            the next year. <sup>21</sup></p>

                        <p>The tobacco industry consistently exaggerate the impact of tobacco control measures on their
                            ability to make profits. In rich economies where smoking rates are falling, tobacco company
                            profits still continue to rise. The companies increase their prices, over and above any tax
                            rises, and so still increase profits <sup>22</sup>. </p>

                        <p>Money not spent on tobacco by those that have quit is then spent on other goods, generating
                            alternative employment. Studies show that most countries see no net job losses and that a
                            few see net gains if consumption falls <sup>23</sup>.</p>

                            promotion on packaging”. </p>

                            consumer products with a high degree of social visibility, such as cigarettes. Unlike many
                            other consumer products, cigarettes are in packages that are displayed each time the product
                            is used and are often left in public view between uses.</p>
